^WPolicies
^W------------------

^Wo^N Multiplaying
 - You may have multiple characters, however only one can be connected at any
   one time, except in the case where one is enganged in a B/R activity (Including
   Program design, deck building, spell creating and upgrading vehicles)
 - Multiple characters may not interact with each other in any way. This
   includes transferring items or nuyen between them or having them share
   vehicles or apartments.

^Wo^N Player Killing
  - Player killing is allowed as long as both parties are flagged PK.
  - Attacking players, casting hostile spells, and attacking player vehicles
    are all forms of PK.
  - Harassing or tricking people into turning on PK is a punishable offense.

^Wo^N Cheating
 - Cheating is defined with common-sense, if you don't have it, you don't belong.
  + Bug exploitation: Those found exploiting bugs for personal gain, or other  
    reasons will be dealt with accordingly.
  + Code-base exploitation, Those found exploiting limitations or what not in the
    code base will be dealt with appropriately.

^Wo^n Mudbotting
 - Botting is illegal, it's strictly powergaming supportive and we do not support 
   powergaming, therefore, persons found MUD-Botting will be dealt with accordingly.
 - Setting up triggers to act while you are away from the computer (build lists for
   automated deck building/spell designing etc.) is illegal. This includes anything
   that periodically sends commands to the MUD. You will not time out if you are
   engaged in something that allows you to stay AFK for long periods of times.

^Wo^N Blacklisting
 - Blacklisting removes major forms of advancement and makes playing the MUD a lot
   harder. Imms will award you the blacklist flag for the following reasons:
   + PK without a valid reason. "My character is a hunter/psycho" is NOT a valid reason.
   + Attacking player vehicles outside of situations that require it. Eg. Being attacked
     by the vehicle.
   + Taking up OOC grievances through IC means. Eg. Hunting down characters ICly just
     because you don't like the player who plays them.

^Wo^n Restrings
 - Items or vehicles must be restrung to something of similar type as the original
   object. Failure to do so will result in you forfeiting ownership and karma will
   not be refunded.

^Wo^n Permadeath
 - Permadeath decisions are always voluntary on the part of the victim of permadeath. 
   Permadeath is purely optional.
 - You cannot refuse to permadeath if you agree to go on a run where permadeath is a
   possibility.

^Wo^n Impersonation
 - Impersonating immortals, mobs, or players with the customize
   command is a breach of Awake policy.  Immortals may ask you to change
   your descriptions for any given reason.  Descriptions should be appropriate
   for your character.

^Wo^n Authority
 - Staff members' word is final, no argument.

^Wo^n Policy Addendums
    Anything written as policy in a help file or the message of the day (type
    motd to read) is considered policy in addendum to this file.

++ All policies are open to change without notice.
