Onan     (Aug 14) [    0] i am sitting in the back of a gmc 4201 with a desktop computer. if i activate gridguide and then attempt to program i get the "You have to be sitting to do that." message. if i sit and begin programming immediately i dont get that message. if i sit and wait a short period and then begin programming i get the error message again. if i actually start programming progress is made while gridguide is active. i think the short period is the time it takes gridguide to change the room i am in.
Sagan    (Aug 27) [ 1825] the merchant scalpels chop shop has an eyelight cyber replacement for 28 nuyen, should be 2200 by cannon, man and machine page 15
Winter   (Sep  5) [62358] I have to be holding a decorative water fountain to drink from it
Ink      (Sep  9) [ 3521] I initiated to grade 18 and 20 magic carrying exactly 825K and wound up with 1018967296 nuyen once I was done.
Milocinia (Oct  4) [    0] In the help file it says that essence returns at 1/Mud minute after projecting but it seems to be refilling at 1/MUD hour.
Milocinia (Oct  6) [32669] I died while having a spirit out and when I tried to summon one it said I have one already but when I checked my spirit list it said I have none.
Sicarii  (Oct 12) [19925] deleting linked skills (that you possess WITHOUT skillwires/knowsofts) deletes the entire skill from your character (the one you had without any cyberware)
Sicarii  (Oct 13) [ 5004] skillwires in general are just buggy, in addition to deleting your actual rating with skills (I just lost my electronics skill entirely), they just don't work sometimes. Had an electronics 5 knowsoft jacked in and I was reading no electronics skill when I typed "skill"
Sicarii  (Oct 14) [ 7229] when I log back on after logging off the night before, skills granted by my skillwires are gone even though the activesoft is jacked in, I have to unjack it and rejack it to gain the skill
Daedalus (Nov  5) [ 2226] point based character generation does not limit allocation to attributes to what can actually be spent. this causes point based adepts to be unable to train adept powers as they will always have unspent attribute points. walter the troll initially encountered this bug and was unable to train adept powers even post chargen and newbiedom.
Onan     (Nov  6) [ 1519] i stopped towing a wrecked or nearly wrecked doberman while rigging another doberman which was inside a gmc 4201 and now i cant find the wrecked doberman.
LeShay   (Nov 11) [12582] For the Rubber Suit shadowrun that has runners going to the Seattle docks, the 'heavyset mafia bodyguards' that use Beretta Model 70s apparently start with no ammo in them, which causes them to immediately stop wielding them when combat starts, before they even have a chance to fire them.
Onan     (Nov 20) [    0] the Ares MP-III Laser in code takes top and on barrel attachments. page 31 of Cannon companion claims laser weapons take top and under attachments
Daedalus (Nov 21) [ 2226] when I have two different weapons in inventory and attempt to bond a clip to the second one in inventory the first gets bonded. while possessing a Beretta 200ST and a Walther PB-120 "bond walther" bonded a clip to the beretta. this bug was discovered by xorex in chargen.
Spindrift (Dec  8) [ 1861] When I die (or sometimes after a reboot) my sustaining foci switch which spells they are bonded to. They don't bond to random other spells, but if focus A was bonded to spell A and focus B was bonded to spell B, after this happens focus A might be bonded to spell B and focus B bonded to spell A.
Spindrift (Dec  9) [35035] It seems like dispelling isn't working right. I can dispel a spell and weaken its strenth indefinitely, but it never disappears.
Spindrift (Dec 10) [62282] I just bought nictitating membranes from the clinic in Union and one of the things it said was A staff member of the clinic says to you, "I can let it go for &d nuyen." It charged me the right price. Not sure if this is a bug or a typo.
Spindrift (Dec 15) [ 9250] Magical skill checks shouldn't be penalized by astral perception, seems like they are.
Shade    (Feb  9) [11502] Room "Alongside Locker Storage" south of "Dockside U-Stor-It" has a desc of "You are in an unfinished room."
Tywren   (Feb 11) [  657] help lists "^yRoleplay: ^nrp..." but no topic exists for "help rp"
Reese    (Feb 17) [ 2282] accidentaly combined bag of optical chips with box of parts.  Box does not get recognized as having optical chips in it for operations that require chips, all that happenendd was the value of the box of parts increased.
Abiola   (Feb 19) [    0] When projecting an under full mental stat boosts, only Intelligence and Willpower are boosted in the projection as the main body is boosted. Physical stats are mirrored from the base stats and Charisma is base, even though boosted in main body. !Super Confused About This!
Ink      (Mar  6) [ 3521] Initiated from grade 31 to 32. Wound up with an extra 800000 nuyen which I've transfered to Feuerschwinge.
Ink      (Apr  4) [ 3521] initiated from grade 32 to 33, wound up with an extra 775000. Wired it to Che.
Onan     (Apr 29) [35610] while rigging the mode and pool commands do not work. I have never understood to what degree combat pool is aplicable while rigging but some pool allocation to gunnery is canon. 
Onan     (Apr 29) [ 1592] when using target command while rigged I dont even see whether I am firing a weapon. i saw "You target an Ultimax MMG towards a Lone Star Security cop" then 2 rounds of "A blow ricochets off of your ride." followed by "*Click*" 
Stryker  (Apr 29) [ 2217] I've run across an item that I dropped in my rented room but now can't pick up. The item is a smartgun link but it's descriptions are different than another smartgun link I have that I am able to pick up. The short description of the item is 'A think yellow wire is laying on the ground.'. The long desc is 'A thin yellow wire runs from a slim black case out to a small three-pronged plug at the end. From all looks of it, and your basic experience, you figure this is a Smartlink.'
Druzem   (May  4) [  606] when I attacked elisio page with a steel combat chain laced with razors, the message that it gave me was that I hurt him with my pound.
Natalie  (Jun  4) [ 4059] at the guarded gatehouse north of the park in Downtown Seattle, when you kill the guards to get the key to unlock the gate, the guards' corpses seem to take precedent over the actual gate when you try to unlock them. For example, when you type "unlock gate" the game tells you "you can't unlock that". Examining "gate" gives the text "that which was living is alive no longer" as with all corpses. Once the corpses are gone then you can unlock the gate normally.
Mikey    (Jun 24) [ 4902] in newbie area I can buy box of ammo, load clips, then sell the used boxes back, apparently for full price--would allow for loading up of ammo and still buying other stuff.
Dusk     (Jul 26) [  610] when in a taxi, if you move in any direction then try to take the taxi somewhere, the cab driver won't respond, and the cab itself won't respond either.
Nex      (Aug  3) [71073] The monowhip gives the wrong message when it does damage. It does damage as a slashing weapon.
Engel    (Aug  4) [    0] help I-90 'no file found' yet listed in map index
Urthor   (Aug  7) [62268] The "SIG-Sauer 716 assault rifle" has an underbarrel smartlink attached on the overbarrel slot when you get it. 
Onan     (Aug  7) [20071] I was hired to escort a bioware research scientist, i mortally wounded a piasma, i then contacted the scientist he followed me to the mortally wounded piasma then i attempted to finish off the piasma and the piasma clashed with the scientist even though the piasma was mortally wounded
Nex      (Aug 10) [    0] Somehow, my MPUV has gained a signature of 254. No effect in mud, but it's still the result.
Daedalus (Aug 17) [ 2226] spohn found that building storage memory does not cost chips. I have confirmed with a test storage memory. parts creation menu claimed it would cost 600 chips but my chips bag has not changed from before i created part till after I finished building the storage memory into a test deck
Spohn    (Aug 23) [ 2013] I am using the @h prompt to show my hacking pool while jacked in.  It is stuck at 0, even though I am using hot asist.  it shows either 0 or 8 to start and gets stuck at 0, never refreshing to 8 at any point.  i tried to set my max=3 to see if it would use a partial amount of the pool but it didn't appear to use the pool at all and then all of the sudden it would say 0, never again to reset.
Spohn    (Aug 23) [ 2013] the max command for setting hacking pool seems to be broken as well. i set max 3 and i get the message that says it will use 3 dice per action.  when i perfom an action, no dice are used.  when i type 'max' it says that it is using 0 dice per action even though i had just set the max to 3.
Spohn    (Aug 26) [10103] Hacking pool doesn't refresh no matter how long i wait while connected.  i'm in hot asist. my hacking pool max is 8.  i logon to mitsuhama which uses my hacking pool entirely. and it never refreshes.
Nex      (Aug 26) [ 2420] You can wield a two-handed weapon while wearing a shield with no apparent penalties. I suspect you should only be able to wield a one-handed weapon with a shield.
Onan     (Aug 28) [14350] my gel round filled shotgun is dealing physical damage "You massacre A psychotic serial killer named Teddy Bear with a single shell from a TEC 603 "Taurus" rapid-assault shotgun."  then diagnose says "A psychotic serial killer named Teddy Bear has some big nasty wounds and scratches and is weary." he was never unconscious
Rock     (Aug 29) [12500] I was recoverng my wrecked doberman from the Mafia hideout in the docks, using a newly purchased doberman to tow it out. I towed it to the dock entrance and had it enter my RV, typed "tow" to release the wrecked doberman and it (the wrecked one) disappeared.
Onan     (Sep  7) [11408] the listings of received mudmail messages flips every copyover or so. this causes my oldest messages to be in the middle of the list and makes it hard to find the third most recent message. this is partially alleviated by the unread messages color but makes reviewing older messages hard
Rabbit   (Oct 19) [ 2079] Sneak bug discovered: If using melee, you do not actually stop sneaking until you manage to close into melee.
Rabbit   (Oct 22) [14656] If you sheath/holster a weapon you are not supposed to be able to wield, you can then immediately draw it and use it anyway.
Rabbit   (Oct 23) [60575] It probably doesn't matter, but you can sell the ammo box back to the vendor at full price, even if it is empty.
Rabbit   (Oct 29) [60563] Select a race with internal penalties to their attributes (troll, orc, etc). Leave their attributes at 6 in point creation. This will grant you an incredible number (6000+) of attribute points. I suspect this has something to do with the game having underflow protection and the game simple rolling it over.
Dog      (Nov  6) [30700] When playing hardcore (and then dying) you can delete your character and remake them since you are kicked to the Awakened Worlds entry screen instead of forcibly logged out. - I have no idea if this has long term consequences.
Daedalus (Nov  9) [ 2226] I had a functioning deck with utilities installed. I uninstalled various parts, i attempted to uninstall the storage memory but got the response "You cannot uninstall that while you have files installed." when I attempt to uninstall the files I get "The cyberdeck is unresponsive." simply extending the list of cant be removed parts to all required parts would make MPCP replacement more complicated. I dont have a solution for what feature to implement.
Durant   (Nov 15) [ 2527] It appears if you create a hardcore character, die, delete your character before performing any other actions or even logging back in not only can you A. delete the character but also B. permanently leave behind a corpse that nobody can access or do anything with.
Ellisandre (Nov 27) [  777] Timothy Shin (the guard for the Masonic Temple) just took my chain for the magic skills quest despite it definitely being mine. I've been keeping it in a chest in an apartment which is where it was for the last copyover.
Spindrift (Dec 17) [ 9282] I think there is a bug where dispelling doesn't work anymore. I haven't been able to successfully dispel anything in a while now. Just weaken or fail, but the weakening happens indefinitely and never fully dispels.
Khai     (Jan 31) [14633] Benelli M1 Tactical shotgun (possibly other shutguns/pistols as well) unable to be used to break down doors.
Onan     (Feb 13) [11407] apparently if you get disconnected while writing a mail when you log back in you won't see tells, global channels, or stomach growls even if you have menugag toggled off. that or something weirder happened to me today but was fixed by quiting and entering
Spindrift (Feb 27) [31705] Dispel is still broken. It could be that my magic score is somehow breaking it, but it's frustrating. It just says You succeed in weakening that spell. no matter how many times I dispel it. Doesn't seem to have any effect.
Onan     (Mar 25) [17523] chase at least should have a helpfile and may not be working right, perhaps have it such that if both drivers are in a group it works a lot easier
Onan     (Mar 26) [    0] maybe just a funky gridguide sent me through the room "Around you is Patrick Way" which has two exits one into a building and the other to interstate 5. I attempted to gridguide from securo ja to tacoma mall and somehow ended up going through this room (it is near interstate 5 which i would expect to use extensively)
Onan     (Mar 31) [35507] gel rounds arent doing stun damage. least not on my shotgun or my walther sniper rifle
Onan     (Apr  1) [    0] I remote controlled my gmc bulldog security a ways while in a taxi and whenever I would drive into a new room I would get no message indicating I had. look command revealed my new room. now when i attempt to manually drive this vehicle I cannot take control. I appear to have no other trouble with other vehicles. that vehicle is presently at coleman and sims in tarislar
Ink      (Apr  3) [62332] a set of retractable improved hand razors -alpha has an essense cost of 0.20 and it should have an essense cost of 0.16 as per core rules. I've already mentioned this to Feuerschwinge.
Peg      (Apr  4) [60373] Novatech 5th floor SE managers office shows Up A closed door when its really a vent.
Reese    (May 23) [    0] when installing the drive by wire system on my bulldog today, i noticed my whiteline shocks were no longer installed.  I still have their stats saved in my notes.  The armored tires i installed at the same time are still there.  They aren't in my inventory or in my bulldog inventory.  They are just gone.  I scrolled up to make sure I hadn't overwritten them when i installed the drive by wire and they weren't there at the start of my day.
Asha     (Jun  3) [22670] I bought armor plates for my van, and some point later I must've put more on, as I noticed the armor of the van was higher than I expected. I put a few more plates on, seeing if there was a limit but they just kept installing. The part that I suspect is a bug is in play is because I put 5 plates on the van to see if I could, raising its armor to 10, but only one set of plates can be removed, and when that is done the armor of the van is 9 instead of 5, as if it had 4 invisible armor plates. I've bought a new van and left the probably bugged ban in the seattle parking garage if you need it to look at it.
Durant   (Jun  7) [    0] if you have your rating's powers in abilities active, and then pick up ware that decreases you magic rating (but, you still have sufficient power points to "pay" for the 'ware) it will not disable abilities; allowing you to maintain more active abilities than your current magic rating.
Durant   (Jun 15) [    0] if you try to gridguide to a location from the E Tacoma, Entrance to a Run Down, Abandoned Building in a vehicle, the vehicle attempts to auto-drive to that location... and becomes stuck.
Durant   (Jun 21) [62198] shields can be wielded with two-handed weapons, by wearing the shield first and then drawing the weapon from a sheath. also, they do not give their full armor bonus, but that may just be a deliberate difference from canon and code.
Lucia    (Jun 23) [ 2242] I woke up in the apartment my character used to rent out a year or so back, and can't get out because I no longer have the key
Durant   (Jun 26) [    0] Accidentally broke the gridguide in my vehicle. Not sure how. Says I "don't have control" when I actually do, and is not using the autonav from gridguide.
Khai     (Jun 26) [    0] The Hammerli Model 610S pistol in chargen features a knife attached to the barrel... by the book, this should be a gas vent I.
Vice     (Jul  1) [35516] I was just creating a satyr with only 6 points in attributes and he got...65,533 points to distribute among attributes. For real. I spent them and they spent correctly, the count incrementing down by one every time I spent one.
Onan     (Jul  5) [    0] if shooting into an elevator and the doors close after the command to shoot has been given the bullet will be expended but the target will suffer no damage. I don't recall any further details but i don't think this was limited to the automatic double tap
Onan     (Jul 17) [30608] when i go to sleep just after gridguiding I apparently wake up every time i change rooms. I know this because the look, wake, and sleep commands respond as though i was awake. i do not know whether this effects healing
Durant   (Jul 19) [ 2008] you can wield two one-handed weapons and a shield or one two-handed weapon and a shield by wearing the shield first and then drawing the weapon(s) directly from a sheath. You can do the same with weapons you are literally unable to wield, as well.
Rhaikh   (Jul 30) [60563] If you delete a compressed file in headware memory, you recover the uncompressed file size instead of the compressed file size
Maliac   (Aug  2) [ 2013] My hacking pool max seems to be constantly resetting itself down to 0, and sometimes my hacking pool itself empties and stays stuck at 0 for long periods of time.
Rhaikh   (Aug  3) [16203] the Driving/Bike 3 ActiveSoft from chargen is really BR/Bike :(
Eliran   (Aug 21) [35036] Ignite seems to bypass rooms with a peaceful feeling. Or maybe just the Trojan store in the Portland Habitat place.
Samriel  (Sep  1) [33021] all of the vehicle mods here are for "the NOWHERE"
Redd     (Sep  3) [11407] kevlar balaclava does not conceal identity
Samriel  (Sep  4) [62284] the Ares Thompson SMG here has an underbarrel accessory on the top slot
Onan     (Sep  9) [32305] in the matrix the first portion of my prompt is icon condition, i was in ewc-man when "A set of 3 sphere runs an attack program against you." and then my prompt said "<  -6 Persona 3136/4800Storage 0Hacking 4AM"
Fjaln    (Sep 11) [ 3474] I got the run to infiltrate jnl's cryo lab. when i connected to the jackpoint in the room 'deeper into the cryogenics lab' there were two files, 'machtech ras override' and 'machtech i/o port' both names match components in my deck (but those components were still present in the deck). i downloaded the files (which were protected by pavlov ic) and a loop started that said "you finish downloading machtech.... etc.. to your deck" for both files, over and over again.  Sorry for breaking stuff :(
Fjaln    (Sep 11) [ 3474] as an addendum to the last bug, i logged out of the mud and reconnected then reconnected to the matrix node. i received one download complete message for the files in question then nothing.
Durant   (Sep 14) [62117] I keep finding NPC vehicles inside various buildings within the Caribbean League.
CheLappy (Sep 15) [    2] can drive past spec procs
Eqrthgul (Sep 18) [16203] Activesofts removed the skills they represented. I had chipjack, skillwires, knowsoft link and head mem installed in chargen. I also got brawling, computers, electronics, and negotitation to 'very good'. After chargen, I jacked in a brawling, computer, electronic and neg chips, and loaded them into memory before realizing they did not enhance the skills but replaced them. I unjacked the chips, went hunting, died twice and noticed my brawling electronics computers and neg skills are now completely gone. 
Samantha (Oct 22) [ 1399] I'm trying to install an Ingram Valiant onto my Ford Bison RV, but the weapon in question fails to install.  I have tried it with both internal and external hardpoints, and I get a blank message instead of a positive or negative response.  I have since tried it with my HK G61A2, using the same syntax, and it worked fine with both hardpoints.
Eli      (Oct 22) [    0] My GMC Bulldog has encountered a size glitch, I had a Harley bike in the back when it happened, I remote controled the bike out of the truck but the back of the truck is still inaccesable.
Mako     (Nov 17) [60574] the progress command shows an absurd negative number while bonding a focus
Martingale (Jan  4) [ 8631] I think the doors around this room should be accessible with the keyword "door".
Mako     (Jan  7) [    0] you don't receive the message about someone suddenly appearing when an invisibility spell is dropped inside a vehicle
Fjaln    (Jan 17) [ 2715] I was on an escort run, the giving john being in the basement of the Lore Store. The target was an abused young woman. I brought her to the escort point and she thanked me for the escort like normal. The problem is actually that my water elemental also thanked me for the escort and stopped following me at the same time (the elemental actually thanked and stopped following first). 
Durant   (Jan 18) [62401] Pelagie Waterfront Apartments - Sauteurs - Appears to be entirely nonfunctional, despite rooms and the building itself being coded in.
LILSLUG  (Jan 23) [ 1107] i am trapped in the unnamed computer store in tacoma. ithe one with three showrooms
Fjaln    (Jan 23) [39343] <right hand (w)>     A KRISS Vector CRB/SO self-loading carbine. Is this supposed to be a single handed weapon? It uses assault rifle skill.
Fjaln    (Jan 24) [ 3000] A few days ago I morted a Lone Star Officer in Tacoma and cast stabilize and heal on him to see how long he'd last. I started out thinking it would be a short expirement and it's now been days and this guy isn't going anywhere. I'm letting the poor bastard go and reporting this creepy ass bug.
Fjaln    (Feb  7) [ 3521] Martingale and I were testing increase attribute spells vs his bioware and adept powers. When improved strength was deactivated, increase strength spell was not able to be cast as he has bioware enhanced strength. However, activating improved strength made it possible for me to sustain the non-cyber version of increase attribute (strength) on him.
Desmond  (Feb  9) [35544] Either something strange is happening with just me, or sometimes, elevators don't alert the occupant when the doors open. Dante's, and EW Center, particularly.
Fjaln    (Feb 10) [ 2960] In regards to mounting weapons on vehicles: I installed an internal hardpoint mount within a GMC Bulldog and attempted to attach various items. Up to assault rifles attached just fine, though there was a problem with ammo that I'll address separately. A light machine gun and an Assault Cannon (actual object short desc.) I could not mount. From within the vehicle the command 'attach cannon 0' (also 'attach cannon mount') returned the prompt, i.e. nothing. I attempted again with an external mount after Ramiel checked into the first instance of the bug. I ununstalled all mounts, emptied the cargo from the truck and installed the external hardpoint. Repeating the process produced the same results. Summary: hardpoint mounts will not accept light machine guns or assault cannons. They will accept assault rifles. Also, related, I was not able to mount a light machine gun onto an external firmpoint mount. I only tried with one light machine gun so it's possible the item is coded as medium or otherwise. 
Fjaln    (Feb 10) [    0] In regards to mounting assault rifles on vehicles, specifically ammo use. I mounted a Colt M22A2 assault rifle onto an external hardpoint mount with a full 40 round magazine and set to full auto (5 rounds). I then filled the mount magazine to 80/80. I fired 5 volleys total between 2 targets. I stopped between targets to unattach the rifle (and ammo box) and noted ammo use. The results are: 25 rounds were used total, 20 from the magazine within the rifle, 5 from the mount magazine. Checking between targets showed that for each 5 round burst, 4 came from the rifle, 1 came from the mount. A previous test with the same weapon on an external firmpoint was conducted longer, showing that after the weapon's magazine was empty, the firing went from bf/fa to semi-auto, drawing one round at a time from the mount magazine. Unattaching the weapon and changing firing settings had no effect on this. Unless the weapons internal magazine has ammo, only semi-auto is possible.
Fjaln    (Feb 10) [    0] Please don't ban me! I tried to shoot a mob vehicle, a Toyota in East Tacoma, with an assault rifle mounted on an internal hardpoint within a GMC Bulldog. I typed 'man' I typed 'target toyota' - the ouput was: You draw a (pistolnamehere), thenYou target a blank ammo box towards a Toyota blah blah.., then Connection to remote host lost.  That's it.
Fjaln    (Feb 10) [    0] I should add that having just checked my equipment, my shoulder holster with said pistol is 'Ready' and the pistol is in there. I might have readied it, I can't check back as my history doesn't go back that far so I can't verify.
Desmond  (Feb 15) [39285] I ended up making an MPUV with a signature of 255 somehow. Started out with the base model from Beverly Automobiles in Everett, and installed, in this order: A dual layer of concealed armor, a T25 Turbocharger, a drive-by-wire mk III, and a sports exhaust system. When I connected to it via datajack to check the stats, I was surprised to discover that I accidentally built a stealth SUV. This is pending an autonav system. I'll append something if that corrects the problem.
Desmond  (Feb 15) [39285] Per Ramiel's Request: 'a sports exhaust system', as purchased from Graagan Auto Parts in the Telestrian Habitat, is the only difference between my Sig 2 MPUV, and the Sig 255 MPUV. If this one's already been addressed, sorry for clogging up the bug logs.
Durant   (Feb 18) [ 2620] Went into a Mine Tunnel underneath the warehouse in puyallup. Exploring around, got caught in combat with a bat. Struck it once for mortally injured. Then attempted to walk away. Afterwards, the game locked me into combat with the mortally injured creature without actually letting me attack it, making it impossible to escape. Eventually the bat died and I broke free.
Fjaln    (Mar  1) [ 2960] I was logged in overnight designing a spell. When I sat down at my computer I had my character stand up, get his pocket secretary from his belt, and check his mail. I typed 'use poc' the menu came up, the Mail option was red, indicating new mail. I pressed '1' and got the message 'connection to remote host lost.' I'll keep the pocket secretary in question in my apartment/garage if someone needs to look at it. I don't know if I should try to buy a different pocsec to try and read my mail.
Durant   (Mar  9) [ 8519] Explot: The costs of training metamagic techniques have a random variable; you can manipulate this by ensuring you always only have the minimum amount of nuyen required in your pocket and attempt to train repeatedly.
Ramiel   (Mar 10) [60570] Languages from a loaded and linked linguasoft are removed when the chip containing it is unjacked
Jaeger   (Mar 19) [    0] I recently got a doberman drone, put a few mounts on it, and started testing it. Twice now when I've typed 't wage' it's crashed the game. I'm going to stop rigging until it's looked at because I don't wanna mess anything up. Sorry o.o'
Durant   (Mar 20) [    0] Pick any race which requires more than the minimum required attribute points. Select points based creation. Input minimum attribute points, 6. The game states it is spending more points than you actually have available to "raise to their minimums." When you go to practice, the game declares you have a number of points to distribute roughly around 65535. Suspected underflow error, cheating fix is linking minimum attribute point expenditure to race.
Zinna    (Mar 24) [35504] Color in a memory entry's name throws off column spacing in the Headware Memory Contents list.
Zinna    (Mar 25) [ 2561] "Outside the Den" mentions "There's a large metal sign attached to the door." but neither "look sign", "read sign", "look north", "read north", "read door", or "look door" give any insight as to what, if anything, the sign says.
Ruby     (Mar 26) [ 4466] This Wolf Shaman practically died when I walked into the room. I'm not sure if it actually attacked me and died to my defense, or if it just killed itself trying to project. Log available.
Maximillian (May  7) [60585] I get "You can't install that in a cyberdeck" when I try to 'install bod-4 deck' or 'install masking-6 deck' which I just removed from the very same deck
Durant   (Jun  1) [12582] Mister Keiretsu gives run to defeat alfredo, rescue yoshi's manager, etc; heavyset mafia bodyguards on entrance to rust boat spawn with no ammo for their guns.
Keth     (Jul  1) [    0] For the Novatech-Helipad-Executive-killing autorun, one of the bodyguards that presumably is meant to have an APDS loaded SMG carries the correct clip, but it's too large for the weapon he loads with. Because I like being shot to death.
Nonzensy (Sep 27) [    0] when i attach a barret 121 sniper rifle to my internal firmpoint mount, it is displayed in the output of mount on the firmpoint mount and the intrenal hardpoint mount also.

Durant   (Oct 16) [60431] for the Novatech job given to you by Thomas Steele, the key to access the conference rooms seems to have an excessively long respawn period
Nonzensy (Oct 23) [62101] in a room called "A small jetty off the shoreline" i got swimming/drowning damage. the room description does not state stat you are 'inside' water.

Talos    (Oct 31) [11407] Heavy Weapons Help File is incorrect. It should reference that the skill used is Machine Guns, not Heavy Weapons, as that specific skill does not exist on-MUD
Keth     (Oct 31) [61504] 'A vicious, serrated steel chainsaw', as purchased from the caryards in Glow City, is a blunt weapon. I don't think chainsaws work like that.
Durant   (Nov  2) [11415] if you use nerve strike on someone the game always refers to them as "he seems to slow down!" instead of what gender they actually are.
Hazmat   (Nov  6) [    0] 0) an internal firmpoint weapons mount (Mounting a TEC 603 "Taurus" rapid-assault shotgun) (Ammo 60/60) <- I attached this to a MCT-nissan roto drone, reloaded it with two full 30 round clips bound to that weapon. I mowed down a wage slave earlier to test and it worked I guess? I never got any combat text and the wage slave's body vanished, and I never used up any ammo. I later accepted the kill slacker mission in  west tacoma and went to do that, same thing, only got the paint dinged messages and "You target a blank ammo box towards Slacker.". I decided to move away north during the combat and the server instantly rebooted.
Hazmat   (Nov  6) [ 2201] I mounted a 2 shot shotgun to the drone and it says it has 60/10 ammo and won't let me load any more into it, but ran out of ammo despite saying it has 60/10 ammo

Gaston   (Nov 13) [18900] Lia says to you, "a pair of red Battlegear(TM) combat boots is tiny piece of furniture. It weighs about 2 kilograms and I couldn't let it go for less than 80 nuyen."
Ramiel   (Nov 14) [ 9994] Cholly the bartender of Blue's is 0.1 meters tall
Gaston   (Nov 17) [25430] two jobs I've noticed it so far; ones that have you kill a target and their crony bodyguards/gangers. If you loot the weapons off the cronies that aren't the main target, then go turn in the mission, the weapons you looted from the cronies will vanish. The ones I've noticed it on are Chas Moreno's kill Cleveland Deleon and take kidney mission, and Mister Johann's kill the two gangers in barrens mission with the minotaur and the troll (I think bull and chigger?)
Gaston   (Nov 17) [10123] I don't think the costtime command works. I've had it set to 100% cost 0% time on a number of part-costing build tests for cyberdeck things and the cost never varied from the base cost. Either I'm using it wrong, using it for the wrong thing, or misinterpreting stuff. Or it just doesn't reduce the cost?
Akamu    (Nov 21) [32675] I think there's a bug with the assassination mission given by Miyoko at Dante's Inferno. Sometimes, it appears the elven diplomat doesn't spawn- only his bodyguards.
Akamu    (Nov 22) [35698] The ramps leading into the Dante's Inferno garage are not connected to the gridguide system. This seems like an oversight, given that the actual garage is- but consequently can only be used to navigate between the four garage rooms.

Mavrick  (Nov 28) [ 9527] um, executives in shintaru are "slashing" they have briefcases in their hands...thought you should know.
Elias    (Nov 29) [ 3521] Trying to "examine credstick" gives funny results when you are in possession of multiple credsticks. Some mobs drop credsticks when killed, so it's not strange to have a bunch that aren't, strictly speaking, "yours". If you have them in hand, and your own personal, activated credstick in a duffel (in my case, I'm wearing it), when you go to examine any of the sticks in your hands you get the readout from the one in your bag. If you try to "examine credstick" with nothing but the one in your bag, you get "You don't see that here." as expected, since it's in a container and not close-at-hand.
Rifkin   (Dec  2) [35610] harold moores sigil quest: costs minimum of 800 to complete (4 taxis total, 250 per taxi with dantes to tacoma or tacoma to dantes costing 60 or so) or 1000 nuyen to complete if taxi order is not perfect and pays a total of 1500, 500 net profit is a joke.
Rifkin   (Dec 21) [14709] some of these mobs are way over powered, especially since dice rolls are hidden. I cannot kill Blue Dawg because he absorbs all my damage, meanwhile with 10/9 B/I, I get one hit punched to death by him from 10P to 0P
Rifkin   (Dec 21) [32638] prone command works independently from the stand command (eg type prone then type stand and it says you are already standing or if in a fight, "do you not consider fighting to be standing?" while sending the prone command again allows me to stand up
Keth     (Jan 26) [32751] The item 'a troll-sized monosword' doesn't give a clash message beyond 'You clash with such and such.', as in, none of the colored 'You whatever a whoever' messages that tell you what's actually going on in the fight -- I have no idea where it came from, I just found it on the clobberdome floor a while back, and only just now used it. Also, Keth seems to be just tall enough to use it, Durant said that he was unable to do so, not sure if that's a bug, or a side-effect of Keth being so tall for an elf.
Anastasia (Mar  3) [    0] There is a duplication of ammo in the Mamman Mall. Short and long arm machines both have submachine gun ammo but the long arm vendor doesn't have sport or sniper rifle ammo.
Anastasia (Mar  5) [30539] my bison has no rear. I am unable to 'switch' to the rear compartment or enter it from the street. It does have items in it, including another vehicle which it allowed me to drive into the back but then told me there was no back so I could not go and retrieve it. I cannot look into the back either. The vehicle is not damaged.
Fjaln    (Mar  6) [12453] I used my pocsec just now and read the only message in my mailbox. It said to please report error #11.

Emily    (Aug 15) [60563] Someone can purchase Active/Linguasofts in char gen, load them into headware memory, then sell them back for free copies.
Mifter   (Aug 23) [22836] So I found what looks like a headware memory exploit: I started with 300mp of mem and a data compactor I. Had 3 files in mem, all rating 5:negotiation, corp and street ett. They are 75mp uncompressed and 60 compressed. I bought a rating 6 elf ett. at 108/87 comp/uncomp. so with all 4 loaded and compressed i had 33/300mp. decompressed and recompressed a bit to see what I could have active and decided it'd be better to delete elf ett and just jack it in when needed. well, i delete elf ett while it's compressed (had negotiation and street uncompressed, so 3/300mp at the time) and saw that the values didn't line up. I deleted everything to make sure and what I ended up with was 342/300. Conclusion: deleting compressed files opens one of the seven seals and is to be avoided.
Ramiel   (Sep 28) [ 3521] Got this just now when Eloi (one of Feuer's morts) sent me a mail. Error #11

Xaeta    (Oct 31) [60565] command
Xaeta    (Oct 31) [60565] Essentially it boils doen to being able to use the kick command in astral form to bash down doors/gates/whatever. pretty darn useful if you ask me. go ghost, fly to the other side of a door and kick it down from the inside if it doesnt work from the outside.

WongHungLow (Jan 26) [ 1861] I can't seem to receive the ring clock from Jim the fixit guy.  List shows it is there, but receive with any of the keywords is not working.  Its the ringclock from Touristville.
Scrapper (Apr 27) [ 9109] Upstairs at Quinn's, in Hallway, his Bedroom door [n] is open, but I can't attempt to kick or bypass the closed door to the south.  "You can only damage closed doors!  But it's already open!"  Typing south results in "The door seems to be closed."  "kick door south" and "bypass south" were the commands I tried.  Thx.
Scrapper (Apr 29) [60563] newchar: male troll physad, points. All 73 points into skills.  allocate skills, but physad trainer says i need to train attributes first.  go back to attribute trainer, and i have 65531 points to allocate.  It let me spend up to max racials.

Liaison  (Mar 14) [ 2958] When i tryed to shoot an npc on the street with my mounted weapon in my doberman the mud crashed. Try look in the attach code, it puts a weapon on a mount, and if you reload the drone then the reload process puts an ammobox on the same mount as the weapon, but you only see the weapon when you check it with the mount command. But you can uninstall the ammo box from the same mount where the weapon is.
Finster  (May 12) [25406] Shankmire run doesn't give partial completion credit when killing jim from astral.

Lucien   (Sep 15) [70300] Integer underflow exploit: Creating a Giant (or probably any other high-initial-cost race) with the minimum attribute points via Advanced creation causes you to have 65535-ish stat points as the unsigned int tries to go below zero.
Lucien   (Oct 14) [70338] You can supply negative numbers to ammo creation, resulting in things like 'pole arm ammunition'.
Lucien   (Oct 14) [70338] The dodge test for flamethrower modifies the 'success' variable, which is then reset with 'success = success_test(...' later on. Flamethrower thus cannot be dodged unless the caster achieves 0 successes.
Lucien   (Oct 15) [ 2961] Lightningbolt cannot be dodged (newmagic.cpp: dodge is subtracted from successes, but then successes is overwritten with a  new valie)
Stryker  (Oct 22) [ 1588] I believe the 'west' exit here is leading to the wrong room. Going west will take you to Auburn Center. Going east from that room will go Third Street in Auburn (as I'm guessing is correct), rather than returning here to the street in Renton.
Armitage (Oct 23) [30176] Mr. Jones in the KE training facility has messed up dialog. He didn't have a job for me and just said (null), also when he gave me the pickup from Knight Center receptionist job he said "I'll find someone else" and then "Are you interested?"

Duke     (Feb 24) [38012] morning star from chargen does stun damage instead of physical
Ethor    (Feb 28) [60563] I can not choose to be transgender or gender neutral during chargen.
Pilum    (Aug 27) [60563] in chargen if you play a troll and take fewer attribute points than 11, the amount needed to raise to your minimums, it seems the integer wraps around and leaves you with over 65000 attribute points to spend
Maestro  (Sep  8) [ 4925] I received a message to alert an imm. well not a message im assuming it's a room description placeholder for my drone being in location (null). I used a snooper (from vinnies) to tow a wrecked snooper (same type) into the back of my bison. dropped tow and the wrecked one went into (null). controlling that drone gives "alert an imm!!!" in all caps. It's a cheap drone so i don't need it back, just alerting because the thing said to do so.
Maestro  (Sep 10) [    0] Mounting heavy weapons on hardpoints appears broken. The operation returns a new line with no indication of why the operation failed when trying to attach an lmg to a hardpoint. Also, my bison has 3 firmpoints (one external) and one internal hardpoint. I mounted a shotgun and 2 assault rifles and left one mount empty. typing mount shows all 4 mounts filled with an 'extra' assault rifle mounted on the 'empty' mount. manning this ghost weapon returns "But there is no weapon mounted there."

Armitage (Sep 23) [ 2961] underflow in points-based creation if you play a race that uses more than what you put into attributes. I made a troll with 6 in attributes and had 65k training points (I deleted and remade with the 11 attribute points needed but most people wouldn't, probably)
