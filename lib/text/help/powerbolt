POWERBOLT

Category: ^gCOMBAT^n
Duration: ^gINSTANT^n

Powerbolt deals physical damage directly to a target and is physical
based. The higher the force the harder it is to resist the damage,
and the difficulty to cast depends on the Body attribute of the target.

Unlike elemental manipulation spells it cannot be dodged.
