CHAOS

Category: ^gILLUSION^n
Duration: ^gSUSTAINED^n

This spell causes the target to have debilitating hallucinations.
It causes the target to have problems doing even simple tasks.
The more successes rolled increases this difficulty up to a maximum
of the force of the spell.

Where as Confusion affects only living targets, Chaos affects both
living and machines equally.
