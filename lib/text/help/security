TALLY "SECURITY TALLY"

While on the Matrix, your security tally is a register of how
aware the host is of your presence. Every time you try to take
any action on the Matrix the host will notice your presence.
How much it notices is dependant on your Detection Factor
(Higher is better). As your Tally raises you will trigger alerts,
IC and even host shutdowns.
