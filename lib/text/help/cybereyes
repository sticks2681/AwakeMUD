CYBEREYES

Replacement cybereyes are very common in 2064, and many variants
are available. Most shops use the same common notation for their
cybereye products:

LL - Low Light Vision
TH - Thermographic Vision
OM - Optical Magnification
EM - Electronic Magnification
FC - Flare Compensation

Optical and electronic magnification allow further vision, increasing
scan range and lowering penalties from ranged combat.
