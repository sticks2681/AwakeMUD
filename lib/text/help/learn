LEARN

Usage: ^gLEARN
       LEARN <spell> <force>^n

Learn is used by magically active people to learn a spell from a
teacher or a spell formula. A spell may be learnt at any force, up to
and including, the force the teacher knows or the force of the formula.
Using learn on its own at a teacher will list the spells the teacher 
knows and at what force rating. Learning spells from a formula may take
some time, and needs either a shamanic lodge or a spellcasting library.

To learn a spell with multiple words in its name you would use the following
syntax:

^c< 10P 10M > learn "increased body" 5^n
