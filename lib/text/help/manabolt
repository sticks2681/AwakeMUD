MANABOLT

Category: ^gCOMBAT^n
Duration: ^gINSTANT^n

Manabolt deals physical damage directly to a target and is mana
based. The higher the force the harder it is to resist the damage,
and the difficulty to cast depends on the Willpower attribute of
the target.

Unlike elemental manipulation spells it cannot be dodged.
