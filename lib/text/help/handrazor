These cyberweapons use the cyber implants skill to damage opponents. 
Hand blades extend opposite the thumb and are more likely to cause 
harm while spurs extend from the back of the wrist and have greater
potential for total damage. Razors extend out from underneath the nails
and their damage potential falls in the middle.
