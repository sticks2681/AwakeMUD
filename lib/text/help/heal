HEAL

Usage: ^gHEAL <target> <damage Level>^n

This command uses an adepts empathic healing power to heal a target
of physical wounds by transfering them to the adept. The target must
be lying down or unconcious and the adept must be able to physically
touch them. An adept cannot take more damage from a target than he could
otherwise sustain without becoming mortally wounded.

The heal spell heals a number of boxes of damage equal to successes
up to the force it is cast at. Heal may only take effect once per
injury set, that is a target must fully heal to their maximum physical
before the heal spell will work on them again.

The lower a targets essence is, the harder it will become to heal
their wounds.
