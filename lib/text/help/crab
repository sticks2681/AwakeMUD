CRAB

Crab is the crusty old hermit of the sea. He carries his home on 
his back as he plods steadfastly through life. Crab may grumble
and complain, but he never wavers in his belief in the way of things.
  Crab shamans are grumpy curmudgeons, very fixed in their ways.
They have no time for frivolity or play, preferring to get right to
the heart of the matter.
