"DETECTION FACTOR"

Detection factor is the average of the masking and sleaze programs you have
running on your cyberdeck. It is a measurement of how hard it is for the system
to monitor your actions. The higher it is the harder time the system has tracking
you. It is used on almost every action you take and is a key attribute for 
stealthy decking.
