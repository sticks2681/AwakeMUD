"CEREBRAL BOOSTER"

Cerebral boosters are treatments which boost the speed the brain
can process information. Available in two levels, the first level
grants the user +1 intelligence, which affects both dice pool and
reaction. The second level adds an extra +1 intelligence and allows
the user access to an extra dice for their intelligence task pool.
