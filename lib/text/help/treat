TREAT

Usage: ^gTREAT <victim>^n

This will attempt to treat a wounded person other than oneself.  It utilises
the ^Wbiotech^n skill, and a rather large target modifier is applied for those
without a medkit.  If successful, however, the victim will recover a varying
number of physical points.  When administered (regardless of whether it is
successful or not), the treated character may not be treated again, by
anyone, for some time.

The treat spell heals a number of boxes of damage equal to successes up 
to the force it is cast at. Treat is easier to cast than the heal spell, 
but it must be cast within one hour of the injury. The lower a targets 
essence is, the harder it will be to heal their wounds.
