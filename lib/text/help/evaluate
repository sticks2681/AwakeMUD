EVALUATE

Evaluates determine which of the many files on a host are particularly 
valuable and then organises them into easily downloadable packages. This 
increases the likelihood of success on the LOCATE PAYDATA function. 

As they evaluate files compared to data markets at the time they were 
designed they effectively degrade over time as their information becomes 
less relevant.
