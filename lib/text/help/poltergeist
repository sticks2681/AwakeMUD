POLTERGEIST

Category: ^gMANIPULATION^n
Duration: ^gSUSTAINED^n

Poltergeist causes small items in the nearby area to fly uncontrollably
around the local area. This causes penalties to most actions due to both
the distraction of flying objects and the difficulty of seeing through
any solid ones.

It may cause light damage to anyone standing nearby.
