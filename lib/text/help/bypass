BYPASS

Usage: ^gBYPASS <direction>^n

This is the modern version of the old "pick" command. Nowadays, no one uses
a lockpick, they use an electronics kit. With such a kit, one can "bypass"
locks. This can only be used on regular doors, not car doors.

Bypassing the maglock authentication allows you to lock or unlock maglocked
doors.
