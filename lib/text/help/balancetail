"BALANCE TAIL"

A weighted cybernetic tail is connected to the base of the 
spine and is connected to an expert system balance processor
which adjusts the tail to keep the users center of gravity
in balance. Balance tails reduce the TN for tests involving 
balance, such as climbing and falling.

The tail is not under concious control and cannot be moved
by any force of will of the user.
