STABILIZE

Category: ^gHEALTH^n
Duration: ^gPERMANENT^n

Brings the target from mortally wounded to a stabilized condition.
This does not heal any damage, it only prevents further bleeding out 
of the subject that is mortally wounded. 

The maximum negative health it can stabilize is determined by the force
the spell is cast at.
