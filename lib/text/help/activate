Activate is used to either activate a focus, adept power or pain editor
or personalize a credstick that has no current owner. Only awakened beings 
can activate foci, and the focus must be bonded to them before they try and 
activate it. No awakened beings can have more foci activated than they have 
intelligence.

This command is also used to activate adept powers so that you may gain
their benefits. You cannot have more than your magic rating in power points
activated at any one time. To activate adept powers that are more than one
word put the power name in quotation marks.
