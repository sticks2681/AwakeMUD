HOUSES APARTMENTS

Houses (Apartments, Condo's, Whatever you want to call them) serve two
purposes. One is to give you a safe place to stay for you and your guests,
and also to store any excess items you may have. 

The housing system is completly automated, just seek out the receptionist
in the building you wish accommodation in and type ^RList^n to get a list
of available houses for rent.

The ^Rlease^n command is used to pay for the first months pay. And ^Rpay^n is
used to pay for any extra months. It must be payed once every real life month
or you will lose access and all items you have stored inside.
