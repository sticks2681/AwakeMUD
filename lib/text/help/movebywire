MBW "MOVE BY WIRE"

Move-By-Wire systems put the users body in a constant state of
seizure, allowing lightning quick reflexes and unparallelled
smoothness of movement. Each rating adds +1 Quickness, +2 Reaction,
an extra initiative dice, and an extra dice for any athletics and
stealth tests.

Users of MBW systems have great stresses put upon their bodies and
as such have short lifespans after installation of the MBW system.
They are normally reserved for creations such as cyberzombies but
some runners with a deathwish have been known to aquire them.

It is incompatible with any other reaction or initiative enhancing
cyberware or bioware.
