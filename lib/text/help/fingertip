"FINGERTIP COMPARTMENT"

This cyberware replaces the tip of a users finger just above the last 
knuckle. This gives them a place to store small items such as datachips
or pills. It is also very popular for storing monofilament whips as the
tip of the compartment can be used as the weight for the whip.
