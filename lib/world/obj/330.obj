pens from rolling off, since most of the people who visit this coffeehouse are
on their lunch hours, a perfect time to catch up on work they haven't

White teas come from the Camellia sinensis plant, just like green tea, oolong
tea and black tea. However, white tea is picked early in Spring when all the
leaves are still in a bud and covered with fine white hair, hence the name,
white tea. The production of this white tea is similar to green tea and has
very light processing and no fermentation, giving it a perfect sweet and
savory balance.

A vase-shaped glass flask of liquid is sitting here.~
LookDesc:$
Tej is a strong and very potent honey wine, quite similar to mead. It is
flavored with the powdered leaves and twigs of gesho, a hops-like bittering
agent which is a species of buckthorn. Tej has a deceptively sweet taste that
masks its high alcohol content, and is served in the traditional rounded
vase-shaped glass vessel called a berele.

unfortunate souls of metahumanity', by which they obviously mean the orks and
trolls unfortunate enough to find themselves within the walls. <read page1,

Basicly, its the 'Crime and Punishment' page, which is an absolute farce in
its finest. If you read through the articles offered, you'll quickly realize
that you're never going to find any of them that feature 'superior' elven
social classes being involved in any wrong doing. They might be the victims in
some of the stories, but certainly never the the perpetrators, its simply
below them. Ahh.. Censorship of media, the Tir at its finest. There is,
ofcourse, plenty of stories about barbaric orks and trolls, and even humans,
who make for the perfect criminal masterminds.

This particular page is chock full of the 'finer' things in Tir life. Between
exposes and interviews with Tir artists, it practically bombards the senses

painting and sculpting, to embroidery, bonsai-like tree cultivation,
manuscript illumination and other art forms, using both conventional and high

It features articles such as "Portland Marchers (5-0) continue their
undefeated streak after their destruction of the Eugene Lords! (3-2)" You can
find all the current statistics revolving around this low-brow game, along
with interviews with some of the more well known players and managers.
