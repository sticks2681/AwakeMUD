This jacket is covered with multiple insignias and racist slogans, along with
various metal pins decorating its surface that consist of much the same, some
of which are comical, and others that are downright crude. Incorporated into
the fabric are protective plates of both hard and soft design, and there seems
to be stiff nylon strips sewn into the interior to stash a large amount of
magazines.

^WHumanis PoliClub^n: ^BFor a Better Future^n. The condition of goblinization, or
^WUnexplained Genetic Expression^n first appeared in 2011. Victims with the latent
genes underwent painful and disgusting physical changes as a result. It is a
^rsexually transmitted disease^n that is always passed on to the offspring of an
afflicted parent. The associated physical mutations range from an abundance or
lack of body mass, malformed ears and teeth, subdermal and transdermal
growths, and a number of other horrifying side-effects. This disease has run
rampant, infecting millions world-wide. ^RNo precautions are being taken to
check the spread of this horrible disease^n. The afflicted need to be
quarantined in order to prevent further spread of this plague. It is for the
purpose of funding research into a cure for this socially debilitating disease
that the ^WHumanis PoliClub^n exists. The other primary function of our group is
to lobby governments and corporations for interim measures to contain the
spread of the problem until such a cure can be found. Our organization ^rdoes
not sanction violence^n, nor will any of members use violence except in
self-defense. Anything to the contrary is slander spread by misguided,
far-left political groups who have been seduced by the power and intimidation
their disease brings them. Your donations will gladly be accepted by the
receptionist or via the Matrix. ^BJoin us in making the future better for all^n.

Name:	a Dragunov sniper rifle
RoomDesc:$
A matte-black sniper rifle lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The SVD (Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova) sniping rifle was developed by
Yevgeny Dragunov in the late 1960's and was designed as a squad support
weapon, taking advantage of its long-range engagement capabilities in an era
where other rifles were optimized for rapid fire combat at close and medium
ranges. Despite its age it remains an accurate rifle that operates admirably
at ranges of a thousand meters and possibly beyond thanks in part to its
original PSO-1 optical sight.

This semi-automatic marksman rifle was designed by the firearm mastermind
Eugene Stoner himself, as evident by its designation "Stoner Rifle 25", and is
manufactured by an Ares subsidiary, Knight's Armament. While it may be a
design that's from last century, it still serves its role as a marksman rifle
admirably. It features a 10-round magazine and comes stock with a high powered
scope and bipod.

While it may be over a century old, at the time of its introduction in 1964 it

mass-production designated marksmen and sniper rifles. Specifically designed
for the legendary SVD rifle, this 4x magnification scope has its body filled
with nitrogen gas, which prevents the fogging of optics and allows it to
function within a wide range of enviromental temperatures.

A sawed-off shotgun has been ditched here.~
LookDesc:$
The Remington 990 is a classic pump-action shotgun. Done in muted silver with
a black stock and pump, it's stylish and carries a large enough load to punch
a hole through an elephant. This particular one has been modified for easier
concealability, with a slightly shortened barrel and a sawed-off stock.

feels cold to the touch, as if it's attempting to absorb the body heat of
anyone coming into contact with, or perhaps it's feeding off of their life
force? You can't place your finger on what it is about the veil that gives you

Keywords:	sword monofilament carps tongue
Name:	a monofilament carps tongue sword
RoomDesc:$
A monofilament sword in the shape of a carps tongue sits here.~
LookDesc:$
The blade of this carps tongue sword is wide and parallel for most of its
length, but the final third is narrowed into a thin tip intended for
thrusting, making it effective for both slashing and stabbing. Symbols carved
along the center of the blade give off a faint red glow, along with the ornate
fittings of the handle, which itself is wrapped in layers of fine red silk and
leather in alternating patterns. The finely honed double edge of this blade
appears to have been treated with monofilament, making for a lethal
combination of ancient and modern technology.

RoomDesc:$
A robust submachine gun has been propped on its end here.~
LookDesc:$
Based on the design of the same name, the Steyr Tactical Machine Pistol, the
TMP-6 takes its cues from the success of the original design. Despite its
namesake however, the robust construction and extended barrel for higher
accuracy make it less compact than its predecessor, as well as its intended
use with both hands to stabilize it during operation in three round burst and
fully automatic modes technically make it a submachine gun in the eyes of the
market and users.
