A few rows of swiveling padded stools line the counter here.~
LookDesc:$
They look pretty beaten down and worn out from time, not to mention the more
than occasional abuse of a sweaty two hundred pound trucker, to which its
creased fabric covering and awkward movement in its swivel. They line the
front of the counter and serve as places to sit at while enjoying your meal.

A small black plastic flashlight lies here.~
LookDesc:$
Its a standard flashlight with no manufacturer markings, encased in relatively
flimsy black plastic, though it does seem to be waterproof and able to stand
up the elements pretty well. It has a rubberized grip for keeping a hold of
it, and functions with a simple click of a button.
