RoomDesc:$
A bulky, jet black cyberdeck has been carelessly left here.~
LookDesc:$
This deck is a legend on the streets. Reputed to be entirely hand made by the
best deckers in the 'plex, the power of this deck has to be seen to be
believed. It is covered in an bulky, jet black casing, to provide protection
to its inner components. As anyone who's opened it up has witnessed, the
inside is a mess. Wires and components joined in a seemingly random order,
making this deck near impossible to upgrade or maintain, even by it's original
creators. Etched into the back are the words "Frag the Corps".
