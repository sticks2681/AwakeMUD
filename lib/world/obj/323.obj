RoomDesc:$
A set of dogtags lies here.~
LookDesc:$
Two completely blank dogtags hang from a fine blackened chain. The tags look
almost identical except that one of them has a faintly discoloured bar-code
strip running down along its length. They are crafted from a nitinol memory
metal that retains its shape once heated or cooled to a specific temperature,
so if they become damaged or mangled they are easily re-set back into their
original shapes.

A bottle of liquor has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
A distilled hard liquor made of honey and anise; sweet with a pleasant bite of
licorice. Described as full-bodied with a healthy ethanol kick. Surprisingly,
hangovers occur much less frequently than with mead. While other
establishments may boast they serve taengele outside of the Tir, these are
merely knock-offs and imitations, as 'The Se-curo Ja!' has bartered the only
contract to dispense the liquor outside of its native territory. This bottle
bears the official Tir Tairngire seal, which stands as a testament to that
claim, as it does not appear on any of its eager clones.

may be something to joke about, the fact that you were forced to sign a waiver

This hand-rolled Ashton 'Esquire Maduro' cigarillo is from the Cabinet
Selection, otherwise known for its vintage, limited edition as the name
suggests, entailing a tobacco "aging process" that is three to four years old
and then aged for an additional year in crates of fragrant cedar. Only the
finest and richest Dominican grown leaf are used for the filler and binder,
providing Ashton with its unique complexity and full bodied flavour. It lights
easily and burns evenly the entire way through, with never a need to relight
it at any time. It begins with a nice balance of rich flavors with a hint of
woodiness, offering a very nice, calming sensation. The second third
maintained the flavor and seemed to add a bit more of a molasses tinge to
itself, while the final third was all sweetness with just a hint of spice. The
Ashton motto is "Pleasure Beyond Expectation", and it certainly lived up to
it.

The Padron Anniversary Series (AS) are among the rarest and hardest to find
cigars in the world, and the 1964 edition isn't an exception. From the square
box-pressed shape to the ornate band, this is a very unique Nicaraguan cigar
that is immediately distinguishable in a crowd. The maduro wrapper tends to be
very dark with almost no veins and a very silky appearance. All you really
need to do is nick the end with the cutter and you will find that the cigar
imparts an ideal amount of smoke and the burn is typically razor sharp.
They're full flavoured and rich, but not overpowering by any means. Flavours
range from cocoa, earth, leather and chocolate. As you smoke the cigar it
tastes better right up until the time you burn your fingers on the nub.

Name:	The DocWagon Special
RoomDesc:$
A fatneck bottle with a DW emblem sits here~
LookDesc:$
The "DocWagon Special" is a house special abomination, which is microbrewed on
the premises of 'The Se-Curo Ja' and remains the only place in Seattle (or the
world for that matter) where you'll find it. It is apt'ly named, as it
certainly lives up to its reputation and has checked many a clubber into the
ICU. The liquid itself is an unknown substance, which makes it hard to
describe either taste or flavour, as it has a tendency to peel off taste buds
on contact like paint thinner on white wash. It boasts to be made of 100% pure
firewater and has a kick like a 2x4 to the back of the skull, which would
probably be a safer alternative than actually drinking this stuff. The label
has the Se-Curo Ja's insignia stamped onto it, while below it sits the
DocWagon emblem. There also seems to be a small map drawn on the side of the
bottle, which apparently depicts directions to the closest DW clinic, since
you're certainly going to be needing it.

A brown glass bottle with a rag sticking off of it is here.~
LookDesc:$
This brown glass bottle full of liquor is better known as The Molotov
Cocktail, one of the house drinks served at the Se-Curo Ja stripclub. The
alcohol contained within is a bit of a mystery, but it smells like its
flammable, realllllly flammable, and if one looked close enough they could
almost see the fumes bending light as they escaped past out the lip on an open
bottle. A tidy burlap 'collar' with a twined tail is tied around its neck with
a simple but sturdy knot, adding even more to its appeal as a criminal
implement as opposed to a decent brew.

The BlackHawk(TM) 'Smooth-Operator' models are the cadillac of protective
gauntlet gloves. Their main fabric is made using a lightweight nomex/kevlar
blend, which allows the glove to be both thermal resistant and cut resistant.
Its thermo-formed knuckle protectors are for added impact and abrasion
protection, while preformed slits in them allow for the use of hand spurs. A
goatskin leather patch on the palm is added for increased durability, making
these gloves not only very comfortable, but allow the wearer to retain most
tactile sensitivity in the palms and fingers. Great all-purpose gloves in both
up-close combat and firearm handling situations.

This nuclear grade, high density, high efficiency particulate air filter has
an efficiency reduction of 99.999% on particles down to 0.12um in size. The
second layer filters chemicals of higher vapor pressure and smaller molecular
size, since its carbon is impregnated with salts of copper, zinc, silver,
molybdenum, and triethylene diamine, which react with deadly gaseous chemicals
to form products that are innocuous or that can be physically adsorbed by the
carbon. This unit is certified to be 99.999% effective against both high vapor

incorporates sophisticated low light, thermographic and ultrasound targeting
and tracking systems into an advanced tactical-analysis data processing system
thats linked into the buildings own security sensors. Between the biometric
scanners, security rigger input and various other security protocols set in
place, the sentry system is able to effectively offer defensive and very
lethal fire over a fairly wide area and initiate multiple threats at once. The
array of sensory input allows the system to guard against nearly any
concievable threat, and since it was built around a modified heavy assault
rifle set-up, it looks as if it could drop just about anything it feels it
needs to.

RoomDesc:$
A fine cigar lies here.~
LookDesc:$
A truly fantastic cigar! This double corona EL is draped in a lush, rich dark
chocolate wrapper with minimal veins and mild tooth. Hefty in the hand, the
construction was superb with no soft spots. Easy light and an even burn, with
the need for only one relight when there was around two inches left. Dense
black-gray ash. Tons of creamy smoke. Started with grass and tobacco. The
first third brought a veritable cornucopia of flavors, including cocoa,
chocolate, vanilla, and that classic Cohiba grassiness. It was noticeably
rich, creamy, and chewy. It feels like one should be describing a candy bar
rather than a cigar! The middle third saw notes of game, honeyed tobacco, and
a sweet tanginess all on a backdrop of grass. In the final third there is a
hint of dark chocolate and a slight floral character. All in all, this complex
two hour, full-bodied cigar is one of the very best to be had. The panopoly of
flavors on this thing mixed with the richness and creaminess is simply
sublime.

A lowball glass of Stolichnaya vodka.~
LookDesc:$
While others have tried to imitate Russian vodka production techniques, they
have never totally succeeded. There are three key elements that separate Stoli
from its imitators. First, Stoli is distilled from winter wheat, which is the
best tasting wheat, not from corn or other grains. Produced in Russia's oldest
distillery, its is considered the classic Russian vodka. Second, virtually all
domestic vodka producers use processed water to reduce the product to its
proper proof, while the makers of Stoli use the purest, softest glacial
waters. Last Stoli is carefully filtered through both quartz and activated
charcoal, then through quartz again.

A stack of delicious mozzarella sticks lies here.~

Served by the dozen, these absolutely delicious mozzarella sticks are enough
to sate the hunger of anyone reguardless of size or preferences. They have
been coated in a mixture of dried italian-style breadcrumbs and finely grated
parmesan cheese, pan-fried in vegetable oil to a golden crisp so the sticks of
mozzarella they contain inside are melted just perfectly. A side dish of
homemade marinara sauce accompanies them, which adds an entirely new flavour
aspect when used to dip them in.

Rich copper color. Toffee and earthy, oily roasted peanut aromas. A rich entry
leads to a vibrant off-dry full-bodied palate with toasted coconut, toffee,
dried fruit, brown spice, white pepper, and wood polish flavors. Finishes with
a chewy tannic fade of rich spice and dried fruits. A big brawny style with
fire and remarkable balance. Not for the week of heart this bourbon is aged 8
years and comes in at 125.3 proof. Sip it chummer sip it slow.

Bombay Sapphire is famed for its smoothness and its nuance. They use ten
different herbs and botanicals to produce Bombay Sapphire, including juniper
berries, almonds, lemonpeel, liquorice, coriander, orris, cassia bark, and
some peculiar stuff called "cubeb berries" and "grains of paradise. This is a
very tasty gin that pricks the tongue and puts the whole of it through some
extraordinary calisthenics.  And despite being 94 proof, it finishes smooth
and clean and without a nasty alcohol burn.

This manifestation of sterling Rihaku is fresh and brash, but as only a small
part of the lees remain, dancing like light snow in a cold February blizzard
along the bottom, much of the original flavor of the sake remains intact.
Light with a good acidity, the nuttiness in the recesses so typical of Shimane
sake still comes through. The fragrance is fairly subdued, but sweeter than
average when you can perceive it. Wonderful served cold.

served with intensely-flavored food. It is a tour de force in Champagne to
enjoy over the next 10 to 20 years.
