sense dried.

A pair of old workboots are lying here covered in grime.~

These old steel toe work boots sem to have been kickin' around for quite some
time. The toes have been worn down right to the steel and it seems as if the
soles have been patched.

Name:	an old ^Rred^N and ^yorange^N synthleather jacket 
RoomDesc:$
^gAn old ^Rred^g and ^yorange^g synthleather jacket has been left here.^N~
LookDesc:$
This relatively cheap synthleather jacket is pretty beaten up, but its still
probably worth a few creds, atleast to the right people. The colours clash
heavily with its ^Rred^N and ^yorange^N design, and it has a large hellhounds head
proudly stitched onto the back of it. Lined beneath the synthleather material
itself are thinly molded sheets of kevlar, which offer a bit of protection
without hindering any movement.

RoomDesc:$
A tie-dye ^gg^Br^ge^Be^gn^N and ^gb^Bl^gu^Be^N synthleather jacket sits in a pile here.~
LookDesc:$
This biker jacket is crafted from an obvious synthetic leather material, and
o' lawdy is it gaudy. The tie-dye ^gg^Br^ge^Be^gn^N and ^gb^Bl^gu^Be^N designs that cover this
article of clothing are near-hallucination inducing in their colour scheme, as
if it were one of those 3D images that you have to stare at really hard to see
the sailboat. It seems to be lined with semi-solid gel packs that act as some
form of protection against impacts and casual bike riding.

RoomDesc:$
An old green bandana lies unused here.~
LookDesc:$
Its a run-of-the-mill bandana, died ^ggreen^N with a few thin ^Lblack^N lined patterns
drawn asymetrically along its surface, which is all but ruined thanks to the
large knot that keeps two of its ends tied together. It has several uses, such
as shining shoes and robbing stage coaches, be sure to put it to good use.
