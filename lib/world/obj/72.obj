A dented pot lid is on the ground here.~

This pot lid has a dent in the middle of the handle, as though it was used as
a shield against an axe or something. There is some blood on it, but you get
the feeling that the user of this lid stayed alive after the fact, seeing as
the lid itself has not been penetrated. That alone reassures you.

The butterfly sword, not to be confused with the western butterfly knife, is a
stout sword with a blade that measures about a foot in length, and as wide as
a (meta)humans hand. The butterfly sword has a small crossguard to protect the
hands of the wielder, similar to that of a sai, which can also be used to
block or hook an opponent's weapon. They may also be used as a knuckle duster
when non-lethal application of the weapon is desired. Following tradition, the
blade of a butterfly sword is only sharpened along half of its edge - from the
middle of the blade to the tip. The blade from the midpoint down is left blunt
so that it can be used to deliver non-lethal strikes and to block without
damaging the sharpened edge.
