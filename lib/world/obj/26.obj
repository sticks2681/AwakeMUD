16 May
	It is difficult to speculate on what precisely has happened to me.
It is, no doubt, related to the goblinization which produced orks and trolls
and their ilk, but in my case...
	My appearance is hideous. The pain is constant. My need for humanoid
flesh remains unabated, despite my disgust at its consumption. I can't even
write properly, my claws get in the way, and I have to use this bit of chalk
to record...
	The thing that frightens me most, however, is the apparent loss of
faculties. This morning I tried to recall the atomic number of cobalt.
Nothing came...I simply forget things, facts, processes, feelings...and
lately, I have begun to view consumption as not a bad thing.
	Could my habits become a pleasure?
