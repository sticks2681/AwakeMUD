RoomDesc:$
A parking meter is bolted down to the sidewalk.~
LookDesc:$
Just a run of the mill parking meter, which consists of a clear plastic meter
to show how much time is left on it, along with a credstick reader to register
credits charged to it. It has a rather sturdy construction, mostly steel, just
to make sure nobody screws with it, though considering it sports some graffiti
that hasn't stopped everyone from defacing it the best they can.

RoomDesc:$
A broken and bent parking meter sits askew on the sidewalk.~
LookDesc:$
Broken down and beat to hell and back, this parking meter hasn't worked for
quite some time if its fogged up and broken plastic casing and gutted interior
is any indication. Half of the keypad is broken and the credstick reader is
nowhere to be found. The steel pole jutting up from the cement is bent in half
and the meter itself sticks out at an odd angle due to it.

A jumble of debris is strewn across the side of the street here.~
LookDesc:$
What was originally pieces of structural foundation is little more than a
messy mixture of crumbling cement chunks, twisted steel rebar rods, ruined
sheet rock and aluminum sheathings with a smattering of broken glass that were
once exterior windows. The entire mess has been bulldozed aside and away from
the main road to keep it out of the way until crews can begin sifting through
it and haul it off to be disposed of.

An old rusted dumpster sits askew in the alley way.~

It originally had a dark green paint job, but almost all of it has long since
chipped and flaked off, leaving behind the bare metal to fend for itself
against the elements, resulting in large portions of its surfaces that have
rusted nearly all the way through.

RoomDesc:$
A broken street sign lays on its side here.~
LookDesc:$
It consists of sturdy aluminum (or at least used to be) folded into a tight
square to create a pole, which has along its length holes drilled into it to
lighten it up without sacrificing its structural integrity. Bolted to the top
are two aluminum panels painted with reflective green paint with white
lettering that read "79th Street" and "Northeast 168th Avenue" respectively.
It appears to have bent and broken near its base, since apparently the welding
keeping it in place finally gave out.

One of the few things that have held up relatively well over the decades of
abuse and neglect, mostly due to their robust and durable construction. Their
paint is flaking off, which was originally a bright safety yellow colour, but
has since faded and looks more brown than anything.

From the minds at Lone Star's R&D Division of Technical Research emerges the
cutting edge in firearm technology. Originally licensed to Ruger to
manufacture under the terms that for the first year all units would only be
sold to Lone Star for a predetermined (and very low) price before being
allowed to bring them to the public market. It fires a controlled burst with
amazing accuracy designed to put officers on a level playing field with
criminals and runners alike.
