^gA carved ^Ccerulean^g marble fountain soars up from the ground^N.~
LookDesc:$
Standing perhaps twenty feet tall at its peak, this tall marble fountain has
been carved in three tiers. The first, at the base, is a large pool ringed by
a single massive ouroboros, with thin jets of water splashing into the pool at
odd intervals to provide a quiet counterpoint to the fall of water from the
second tier, the middle. The second tier is a wide bowl of water with carved
cherubs and angels sitting around its edge, their cool marble eyes looking out
upon the world. The highest tier, the third, is a marble spire from which a
flowing wash of water streams.
