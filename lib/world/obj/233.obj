Outfitted with the latest in patented WuXing nanotech which recharges the
battery by utilizing a mixture of body heat, residual heat from the lasers
themselves and the surrounding area, it is one scary - highly effective - and
long-lasting weapon. This version of the Assault Cannon has been created with

is the name, "Lu Bu."

provide low-light, thermographic and even light refraction detection.

A large, cylinder shaped object lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This laser weapon has been in development by WuXing Division W for many years,
only now coming to fruition. It generates an extremely high-intensity beam
which has the capability, given the right power supply, of tearing through
advanced alloy armor, or simply creating a lower-frequency beam to blast a
hole through organic targets. It has thereby become standard for Black Guard
anti-armor and anti-aircraft divisions, given its long range and reliability.
During research, it was also noted as being useful as a mimic of a sniper
rifle - only more powerful, and far more expensive.
