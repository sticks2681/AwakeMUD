RoomDesc:$
An inhaler tube of some kind has been discarded here.~
LookDesc:$
This here is Adrenocoricotrophic hormone, which is a mouthful to say, so
everyone on the streets just calls it ACTH. It comes packaged in a flimsy
little plastic inhaler, and once you take a deep breath, the naturally
occuring hormone goes to work immediately. It is primarily used to voluntarily
trigger the activation of adrenal pumps, and while not addictive, users tend
to build up a tolerance to it over time, eventually rendering it ineffective
as an external trigger.

Name:	a syringe of Hyper
RoomDesc:$
A sterile syringe is sitting here, waiting to be injected.~
LookDesc:$
This syringe is packed full of Hyper, a direct neural stimulator, which acts
on the nerves connected to the lobes of the brain that interpret the majority
of nerve sensations, including but not limited to, taste, smell, sound and
sight. Hyper artificially produces the effects of hyperaesthesia, a condition
of excessive acuteness to sensory stimuli, resulting in pain from even the
most minor of sensations. A light tap registers as a hard blow, and the
softest whisper becomes a loud shout in the ear. Wanna get ripped outta your
gourd? Then Hyper is right up your alley.

Keywords:	Jazz inhaler single-dose
Name:	an inhaler of Jazz
RoomDesc:$
A single-dose inhaler has been left behind here, looking lonely.~
LookDesc:$
Developed by the good ol' boys over at Lone Star's R&D Division labs. Jazz was
initially designed to help run-of-the-mill law enforcement officers who run
against the slotted assortment of heavily wired and chromed out street
samurais. Designated officially as an "energizer", Jazz significantly boosts
the user's reflexes and reactions for a short period. Users often suffer from
crash periods after it wears off, and those who over-use or use it too often
have been known to have been subject to brutal side effects.

RoomDesc:$
A white and violet pill goes to waste here on the floor.~
LookDesc:$
This designer drug has recently hit the streets and shadows, and is allegedly
produced by the brain-trust over at MCT. Psyche stimulates the brain into
hyperactivity by interacting with neural receptors, increasing the users
ability to concentrate by a severe degree. It is especially prized amongst the
magician crowd for this very reason, but, like any designer drug, abuse is
known to cause unwanted side effects.
