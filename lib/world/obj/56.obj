 Your first sensation is a cool silk
dress against your strong but suple orkish body. The second is a beautiful,
dark haired woman woman smiling at you. You smile back to her as she takes
your hand and steps out of the limo.
 You look at the expensive boutique, then head inside, hand-in-hand with your

 [The time indexes become sporadic as the recording is turned on and off, but
it becomes quite clear you (the ork woman) and the human woman spend the day
driving around in a limo and shopping at expensive boutiques.]
 [After dinner at a posh resteraunt, the couple returns to an equally posh
apartment. They share a shower, then retire to bed for an evening of loving,
tender intercourse.]
 [TIME INDEX - ERR/ERR/2062 0900 PST]
 You wake up alone and cold. You slip out from under the covers, your body
pleasantly sore from last night's activities. You slip your feet into a pair
of slippers and pull a robe around you. Smiling to yourself, you head towards
the kitchen.
 When you get there, the door is ajar. You push it open and stop, gasping.
Your lover is there, what looks to be a half-eaten a human leg in her hand,
her mouth covered in blood.
 You scream, slam the door, and run out of the apartment. [RECORDING

 You find yourself looking at the

headboard. You lift your head and look down the lengh of your fine body - you
realize that you're tied, spread eagled on the bed.

 You scream as he climbs on the bed with you. The pitch goes up even louder as
he unfastens his pants and begins having his way with you. You try to fight
him, but the bonds are too tight.
 After a few moments of his savage attack, he draws a gun and points it at
your forehead. Still ravaging your body, he squeezes the trigger. A blast of

She appears to have been a member of one of Seattle's many hordes of
streetwalkers. Upon closer examination, the cause of death becomes obvious.
She has large chunk of flesh missing from the base of her skull, where the
hair has been neatly shaved away. The clotting blood makes it difficult to
tell, but the wounds look like they were made with a sharp blade.

His still blue eyes open, in an expression of abject fear, and his hands are

clutched tightly to himself, from his knees below his chin to his neck curled
tightly over them, revealing a bloody wound. A section of flesh has been
removed, obviously with a sharp blade of some kind, although the direction of
the cuts show clearly that they were not made without a struggle.

his mop of greasy grey hair, under his ear and dissapears under his unkempt

 Upon inspection, you find that the hair at the base of his skull has been
removed, and a series of neat, surgical cuts have been made, deep, and a
section of flesh has been removed, revealing a bleached-white vertebrae, with
a neat puncture hole dead in its center.

A young girl, in her late teens, lies stretched out here. Her mouth hangs open
slackly and she stares into space, one arm flung out such that if it wasn't

She is dressed as if for a night out, in trendy, revealing clothes, now soiled
by grime and blood. Upon examination, her strawberry blonde hair has been
shaved past its dark roots at the base of her neck, and a deep wound, obscured
by blood, provides an obvious cause of death.
