This four foot by six foot acrylic painting of a lush, primeval forest is
exquisitely rendered in vivid detail. Glowing beams of light peek down through
the mist at the top of the leafy canopy of majestic, towering redwoods and
other old-growth trees. The morning dew still coats the verdant prongs of
sun-streaked foliage that make up the forest floor. Small frogs and toads can
be seen hiding among the different ferns and mosses, while dragonflies orbit
around the reddish brown tree trunks and fallen logs. At the center of the
scene stands a lone wolf, proud and stern, with a yellowish streak swirling
through his thick fur of grey and white and a faraway look in his soft, blue
eyes.
