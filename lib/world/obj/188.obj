RoomDesc:$
A large canteen lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The large survival canteen is a must have for anyone going into the rugged
unknown. The canteen's plastic cylindrical shell (in respects to size and
shape it resembles a small artillery shell) is coated in a semi-permiable
membrane which soaks up condensation and moisture in the air and, along with
filters, turns the captured moisture into drinkable water contained in the
canteen. Unfortunately this process is not capable of keeping a canteen
constantly full so refilling the canteen is required.

RoomDesc:$
A simsense chip with the label 'Ancient Youth' on it.~
LookDesc:$
This is the much awaited single by Speed Coma called 'Ancient Youth', inspired
by the tragic news story of the death of an innocent youth who was a new
Ancients recruit at the wrong place at the wrong time. Much of the song draws
from the words and emotions of this young ganger from the so-called 'flatline'
tapes, a recorded cellular conversation he had made to a friend as he was
slowly dying from gunshot wounds. The quiet and haunting ending with the soft
wimpering of the dying ganger is a move away from their usual formula but
serves as a chilling reminder of the message and reality on which this song
draws from.

LookDesc:$
'Grave Humor' is the latest single released by Suzie and The Banshees.
Haunting, trance-like melodies ride on a wave of strong vocals by Suzie and
eerie vocals of the Banshees, living up to their name. The lyrics seem to poke
fun at the eerie nature of the music and backing vocals, like someone trying
to (unsuccessfully) laugh off their fears, but at the same time lines like
'grave humor is what I die for, anything to ease the pain' bring you back down
to earth as to the tone of this song, namely death and fear.

This tight-fitting yellow t-shirt is one of the latest fashion items from the
Persian Kitty Underground, a popular line of clothing with the Japanese youth,
imported direct from Chiba City, Japan. It certainly shows. What the hell is a
Persian Kitty Underground? Or why is a cute looking cartoon character of a cat
wielding what looks to be an submachine gun? And what does the phrase 'We Win
Unanimously' printing on the back of the shirt mean? Whatever the case, this
line of clothing is very popular with the youth, and if you want to be apart
of the 'in' crowd, this is your ticket in.

This tight-fitting pair of shorts is one of the latest fashion items from the
Persian Kitty Underground, a popular line of clothing with the Japanese youth,
imported direct from Chiba City, Japan. These pair of shorts are the ultimate
accessory to go with either one of the Persian Kitty Underground's tight
fitting t-shirts that are available. On the right side of the front of the
shorts is a cartoon character of a cute cat holding a submachine gun out,
aiming at a cute bulldog, also a cartoon character, lying prone on the left
side in what looks to be a detective's outfit. Anthough the dog detective may
have a frown on his face, the scene has a light, playful feeling to it. The
words 'Running Is Unfortunate' and 'We Win Unanimously' are printed on the
left and right rear pockets opposite the dog and the cat respectively, on the
back of the shorts.

This tight-fitting blue t-shirt is one of the latest fashion items from the
Persian Kitty Underground, a popular line of clothing with the Japanese youth,
imported direct from Chiba City, Japan. The shirt actually has nothing to do
with a 'kitty' but instead a sad looking cartoon character of a cute bulldog
is printed on the front of the shirt wearing what looks to be a detective's
outfit, the kind you commonly see on trid. A white collared shirt and brown
trousers are worn under a long brown coat with a silver badge attached to the
coat's breast pocket. In a paw, a handheld magnifying glass is held by his
side and the words 'Rueful Dog Detective' are stacked on top of one another to
one side. On the back of the shirt, the phrase 'Running Is Unfortunate' is
written in large letters.

For some reason, unknown to all except the youth, it seems that the Benedictus

styled in a similar fashion to a monk's habit, with the generous, loose
sleeves, in which the arms can be hidden away, just like with the monks on
trid. Instead of having hand-warmer pockets on the front of the jumper, there
are small pockets, one in each sleeve, to store loose change or gum. To top
things off, this jumper has a large, loose hood, to give you that mysterious,
shadowy appearance.

LookDesc:$
You see a simsense chip through a clear plastic window on the front of the
protective case. The simsense is an elven adaptation of the popular Rose
Knights Trilogy, a novel written at the turn of the century by the S.Thomas
Parker and is a story set in the lands of Kylandra, a land tormented by chaos
and war between The Three Kindoms. The story centers around Llyndom, a young
squire serving under Lord Isham, Lord of the Highguard and knight of western
kingdom of Pellan, who forms the order of the Knights of the Rose with like
minded knights from all three kingdoms to topple the corrupt rulers and bring
order to the lands. It is from Llyndom's perspective that most of the simsense
takes place, as well as a few key characters in scenes he is not involved in.
On this special edition simsense chip, the perspectives of all the characters
may be taken, right down to the lowly beggar. A bonus feature on the chip
includes interviews with the cast and the director, a behind-the-scenes view
of this epic masterpiece as well as some humorous outtakes of various scenes.
On the back of the case, there is an episode summary to each part of The Rose
Knights Trilogy.
(Use read episode# to view the summary of each episode).
