Name:	A Heckler and Koch P7M13 Light Pistol
RoomDesc:$
A short-barreled hammerless light pistol lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The P7 is probably the greatest light pistol on the market.  Chambered for a
cartridge bordering on Heavy Pistol, the 9x19mm or 9mm NATO round, the P7
outperforms any other pistol in it's size class on the market. The cold hammer
forged polygonal bore barrel is top quality, and unlike the Glock handguns
which simply have a concealed hammer, the P7 truly is hammerless, using a
spring propelled firing pin. Tied into the squeeze-cocker at the front of the
grip, the firing pin is totally blocked if not in the hand of the firer,
preventing accidental discharges from dropping entirely.  The gun sits low in
your hand, nearly adjacent to your index finger. Because of this, it's a
simple matter to point the P7 instinctively, becoming a literal 'point and
shoot' handgun.  The magazine capacity is 13 rounds, and this military model
is loaded with +P Black Talon ammunition.

The Heckler and Koch USP45 Tactical is essentially a scaled-down version of
the Mark 23 Model 0, or SOCOM handgun. It features a threaded barrel and
integral mounting rails situated overbarrel. Though less accurate than the
SOCOM due to it's shorter barrel, it is still extremely effective, due mostly
to the higher than standard powder load they implement.

RoomDesc:$
A polished, heavy pistol waits to be picked up here.~

The original Auto Mag pistol was conceived by American businessman Harry
Sanford during late 1960s. Sanford envisioned the semiautomatic pistol,
similar in power to the very powerful Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum revolvers, but
with less felt recoil and a higher round capacity. This particular production
model number is 280, and is made to fire the trusty .44AMP caliber round. The
key niche for such monstrous pistols was handgun hunting (a sport rather
popular in USA), as well as silhouette shooting. It must be noted that back in
the early 1970's Auto Mag pistols were in a class of its own, as there were no
other production pistols with such power; rivals like Wildey and Desert Eagle
appeared later than the old grand daddy Auto Mag.

and manufactured until 1936. Lately, Colt at least twice reintroduced this
popular revolver, last time in 1973 as the Colt Detective Special 3rd issue,
which this particular model is. Chambered for a .38 special round, this baby
packs enough of a punch to still be a contender in the shadows.

The story of the first semi-automatic rifle ever widely-adopted as a standard

John C. Garand began to develop semi-automatic (or self-loading) rifles. When
the USA entered the WWII, the mass production of the M1 rifles was set up at
the Springfield armory along with Winchester. During the war, both companies
developed about 4 million M1 rifles, making the M1 Garand the most widely used
semi-automatic rifle of the World War 2. During WWII, the M1 Garand proved
itself as a reliable and powerful weapon, gaining an almost cult following in
the process, and for good reason.

The experience gained during the first part of the World War 2 showed some
deficiencies of the existing rifles, both manually operated and
semi-automatic. Those rifles were too long and heavy, and fired too powerful
cartridge that had excessive recoil and effective range of about 2000 meters,
while most fights were at distances of no more than 600-800 meters. The SKS
(Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova = Simonov Self-loading Carbine) was designed
by famous Russian arms designer Simonov, who set out to design a gas operated,
magazine fed, self-loading rifle. Being a sound, but outdated military design,
the SKS is a great all-around civilian arm, capable of numerous functions:
small and even a medium game hunting, plinking or home defense.

The HK Urban Fighter is a heavy pistol from the Urban Family by Heckler and
Koch, which comes along quite fully in the good old urban style both in
sculpture and ceramics. Made a sensational seven inches long and weighing
under a kilo, it is surprisingly compact for its size, making it relatively
easy to conceal from most standard searches. The weapon comes standard with a
top mounted Smartlink-II, its design not allowing for other accessories to be
installed. With this weapon, the ammunition is in sealed magazines, which are
sealed by chemically treated strips, which cannot be detected by chemsniffers
unless the seal is broken or has been loaded into the firearm.

is undoubtedly the high capacity magazine, which can hold a magnificent 18

fired so fast that the felt recoil is only from the second salvo. The G61

This weapon is mainly a draw for collectors in a small series usually directly

unexplored, but uses more of the old 2-D movies and series than from reality.
The weapon can, like most shotguns, be loaded with shot as well as solid slug
shells, and the reliable repeating mechanism makes the Desperado in actual use
a trusty companion on the road. However, the recognition due to the small
numbers in the shadows as well as the fancy designs, in most cases, is too
high to be used for illegal operations. Custom accessories are available for
the Desperado, but it can be adapted to normal accessories as well, but this
would ruin the Western look completely, making it undesirable for most owners

Name:	a PJSS LNB/13 "Schinderhannes" lever-action shotgun
RoomDesc:$
An old western-styled lever-action shotgun has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
The LNB/13 "Schinderhannes" is made by the production "Sohler Community
Hunting and Sporting Weapons", is a direct replica of the American licensed
Desperado. This short cycle shotgun, which is also meant more for collectors
than for road warriors, is high up on the German markets, its price
approximately the same as its American counterpart model. It is also the same
with regards to the usability of external accessories. The short barrel gives
the Schinderhannes the range of a heavy pistol, and the choke is not
adjustable, instead it must be specified when placing an order for the weapon.

A crowd control shotgun has been left behind here.~
LookDesc:$
The grand daddy of crowd control firearms, capable of firing standard shotgun
shells, rubber bullets and gel rounds. This is an insurgency suppression
weapon, which is found in fairly small numbers on the streets. The weapon is
about as accurate as a heavy pistol at the same ranges, regardless of the
munitions being fired. Its unique barrel rifling keeps it from accepting any
accessories, but sports top and underbarrel rails for variable accessories.

A heavy machinegun has been left here, waiting to spit molten lead.~

This is the standard heavy machine gun support for the MET2000, and is
especially rare on the streets, as getting ahold of them, through both legal
and illegal means is not easy. Nevertheless, the Ruhrmetall SF20 is very
popular among mercenaries and samurai, and it is known for its quality,
stability and reliability under extreme conditions. It comes standard with a
built-in gas vent III system to compensate for its enormous recoil. The
ammunition supply is done either through a self-dissolution belt-fed mechanism
or an 80-round box. The weapon can be fitted with any standard accessories for
both top and underbarrel mounting.
