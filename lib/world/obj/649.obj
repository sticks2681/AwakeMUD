sets of lenses set on top of the other. The first for ultrasound mapping, the
second for thermographic and low light.

A large, bulky mechanical arm lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This is a standard gyromount system, made to carry heavy weapons. It clamps
onto your back, and forms a type of gyro assisted metal shell around your main
firing arm. While this also provides limited additional protection, it is also
extremely limiting on movement and makes melee combat nearly impossible.

An advanced mechnical arm lays here.~
LookDesc:$
This deluxe version of the standard gyromounting systems is slightly better at
recoil nullification, and can take a little more abuse than the standard
variant. Nevertheless, it still encases the user's arm in a mechanically
assisted shell; it also severely limits the user's movement and remains
difficult to use during melee engagements.

Name:	a form-fitting Ruthenium polymer combat suit
RoomDesc:$
A slim suit of form-fitting armor lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This jet black form-fitting suit has a layer of Ruthenium polymers on its
surface, allowing it to create a 'chameleon' type of effect when activated to
cloak the user from basic eye sight. The suit also comes with 5 small scanners
attached in various point to obtain the background color information necessary
for cloaking. Small pads adorn the arms, legs, and body areas of the suit.
These pads are placed beneath a layer of advanced kevlar weave, granting the
user limited armor protection should stealth fail them. While the Ruthenium
system is somewhat vulnerable to EMP effects, and unable to cloak properly
when moving at high speeds, this suit is still well suited to stealth
operations. It's also thin and light enough to impose no restrictions on its
wearer's movement.
