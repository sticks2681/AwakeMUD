Keywords:	Ghost heavy pistol STK
Name:	an STK 'Ghost' heavy pistol
RoomDesc:$
A sleek black heavy pistol is lying on the ground.~
LookDesc:$
4 The perfect choice for anyone involved in covert ops. The Ghost is small,
lightweight, sturdy, and packs more power than a Predator. The entire gun is
made completely out of ceramic components, rendering it literally invisible to
MAD systems, hence the name. The light weight of the weapon is not to be
misinterpreted. This thing is built solid, and made to work under all but the
most adverse conditions. Unlike standard heavy pistols, the Ghost is capable
of accepting accessories under its barrel in addition to on the barrel and
above it. The barrel, while not requiring a silencer, is built specially to
work with one. When one is attached, hardly more than a very hushed whistle of
disturbed air is heard when the Ghost is fired. Even the paint on the gun is
designed for maximum stealth, posessing a pitch black non-reflective coloring.
An internal high-power laser sight comes standard with the weapon. The phrase
"Shoot To Kill" is etched into the handle, signifying it's creator.

An intimidating medium machine gun is resting here.~
LookDesc:$
The ultimate in squad level support weapons. This medium machine gun rips out
firepower through a dual-feed firing mechanism operating off of two 35-round
magazines. Big, fairly heavy, and built as solid as most armored vehicles, the
Judgement is a truely impressive weapon. Able to handle recoil with uncanny
ability, compliments of the gas vent 4 system, this thing puts Ultimax and
FN's medium machine guns to shame. Aside from the barrel, the gun is painted
an imposing smooth black color. The barrel, made out of titanium, and covered
in a chromium coating, is able to sustain incredible amounts of firepower
without much heat build up. This is a life saver when it comes to preventing
barrel warping under excessive use. The gun is also RIS (Rail Interface
System) fitted, allowing attachments above and under the barrel to easily be
slid on and off. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the handle,
signifying it's creator.

Keywords:	STK nemesis gyrojet pistol jet 
Name:	an STK 'Nemesis' gyrojet pistol
RoomDesc:$
A sleek, high-tech pistol is laying here.~
LookDesc:$
Based on the concept of the FN-AAL gyrojet pistol, the Nemesis has design
improvements which allow for better land functionality. Still remaining
operational underwater, it fires an improved 6.5mm rocket, rather than the
standard 6mm. The engineering of these rounds is made specifically for greater
range and higher velocity, in order to make the weapon a little harder to
dodge by those wired to hell street samurai. The drawback is a slightly
smaller magazine capacity, and more weight in the pistol itself to withstand the
added launch power. The rockets themselves, once fired, emit an audible
high-pitched shriek as they travel through the air. Due to the special design
needed to accept and fire the rocket type ammo, the Nemesis is incapable of
using barrel mounted attachments. To make up for this however, it has been
designed to accept attachments both above and below the barrel. A special
high-powered laser sight made for underwater operation is built into the
weapon. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the handle, signifying it's
creator.

RoomDesc:$
A large, imposing shotgun takes up part of the ground here.~
LookDesc:$
A nasty shotgun by any measure, it packs the punch of a Spas-22, but with a
higher ammo capacity and more optimizations. The Stormhammer is made
specifically to fire rifled slugs, and it has numerous smoothly made holes
going down the length of the barrel. While it creates a large and frightening
muzzle flash because of this, it also acts as a type of gas vent. A high-power
laser sight is built internally into the gun for greater accuracy. The bullpup
configuration of the weapon, which places the trigger well in front of the
magazine, makes this shotgun even easier to handle... As well as hide. But the
Stormhammer is in no way a stealthy weapon, its very name is derrived from
the thundering, bassy noise it makes when fired. The Stormhammers construction
also seems quite sturdy, and weighted in key points to make it an effective
last-resort clubbing weapon. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the
handle, signifying it's creator.

In a direct attempt to make the Ruger Thunderbolt look like a cap gun, Shoot
To Kill created this monstrosity of a heavy pistol. The Juggernaught is
designed from the ground up to be a frightening weapon. A square and blocky
shape, with a visibly weighted barrel and largely extended magazine make this
pistol hard to conceal. Many small slits are made on the upper right and left
sides of the reinforced barrel, making even the muzzle flash look
intimidating. The entirety of the gun is a smooth silver color, with the
occasional black metal plate for style. The Juggernaught takes firepower to a
whole new step, able to fire in semi, and fully automatic modes. To strike
further terror in your foes heart, firing this massive pistol unleashes an awe
inspiring bassy roar. Aside from the gas venting and heavy barrel to reduce
recoil, the Juggernaught also sports a very soft rubber grip to keep it stable
in the firers hand. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the handle,
signifying it's creator.

RoomDesc:$
A sleek looking assault rifle rests here.~
LookDesc:$
The Virulence assault rifle, one of STK's most prized creations. This weapon
is the epitome of versatality. It's size is more compact than many SMGs, and
it's fire power is still able to contend with the better assault rifles.
Partial composition of ceramic materials also make this assault rifle harder
to detect by MAD systems than normal. Bullpup style design, with the trigger
placed well in front of the magazine, improves the weapons concealability and
handling. It's accuracy is even further increased by a level 3 gas vent
system. The power of the Virulence mainly lies in the special chambering,
designed for the best use of the propellant force behind the 7.62mm caseless
ammo it takes. One other unique feature, is that the weapon is designed to
break down and be put together again rather easily... Allowing it to fit into
a small briefcase. The gun is also fitted with an RIS (Rail Interface System)
to allow attachments to be quickly slid on to, and off of, the top and bottom
of the weapon. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the handle,
signifying it's creator.

RoomDesc:$
A compact, but dangerous looking SMG lies here.~
LookDesc:$
Want a good SMG that isn't one of those 15 million MP5 variants? Then the
Phalanx is the gun for you. Not even loosely based on the MP5's design, the
Phalanx takes on a more circular, streamlined type of appearance. It's barrel
is hidden under a small blocky covering made to channel the force of the
expelled gas from firing to help compensate with recoil. The stock is neither
folding nor rigid, but rather able to actually be pushed inside of the gun,
and then brought back out by the push of a button or smartlink command. When
extended, the thin stock helps cushion pressure on the shoulder with a complex
spring-loaded system inside the gun. It's also able to be adjusted in length
to better suit the size of the users arm, and make firing more comfortable.
Another distinguishing characteristic is that the magazine loads in diagonally, and
on the top of the gun. The stock, coupled with the small size and relatively
light weight of the Phalanx, make this an excellent choice for concealable
fire power. However, the stealth of the gun is lowered by the inability to
accept a silencer. On the plus side, it generates noticeably less noise than
is normal for unsilenced SMGs. The phrase "Shoot To Kill" is etched into the
handle, signifying it's creator.
