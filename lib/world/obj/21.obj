This electronic datapad is the Chiphead's Guide to Roleplaying Games, a primer
for beginners to the culture of roleplaying games and how to enhance your
roleplaying experience. A little discount 'damaged stock' sticker is stuck
onto the front of the unit with the discount price marked on it, which is a
bargain compared to most of the other datapads and simsense chips that are
available. There is a power button just below the large touch screen of the
unit, which when switched on, displays the guide's index.
(Use 'read index' to turn on the unit and read the index).
