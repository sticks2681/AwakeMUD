The taste of heaven.  This is what caffeine is all about.  The mocha.  Whipped
cream, real, not synthetic.  Espresso made from actual ground coffee beans
from Amazonia.  Real chocolate from beans processed in Amazonia.  None of that
Aztechnology drek that claims its real, but the real deal.  Caffeine addict
heaven.
