LookDesc:$
This medium sized helicopter is a 2050 WK-2 cargo variant, updated and
refitted from its WK-1 2012 design. This baby is fast enough to keep up with
just about anything around, but pursuit and patrol weren't first or only
priority, far from it actually. Several forward-mounted gun platforms were
attached to its frame, as well as rear-facing cargo door mounts, all of which
are stacked with heavy machine-guns, just itching to be put to use. A gun-pod
sits below the pilots cabin, complete with a swiveling turret and flood light,
just in case you had any ideas about hiding or trying to out-maneuver this
thing. Fortunately, since its been put up for 'valuable' cargo deliveries and
shipments, the only time it might cause anyone any trouble is if they're
stupid enough to try and hijack it.

Keywords:	sword vibro vicious mechanical
Name:	a vicious looking vibro sword
RoomDesc:$
Some kind of mechanical sword has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
The vibro sword lives up to both its namesake and reputation as a vicious
close combat weapon. Its serrated blades vibrate at a rate of more than twenty
times a second, acting like a saw as it chews through both armour and flesh
alike with ease. The handle is a bit larger than most swords on the market,
mostly due to the fact that it also doubles as the battery housing. Stealth is
simply a function this weapon does not possess, since once it is activated, it
emits a very audible hum due to its vibration.
