You see a datachip with a nasty pornographic image on it sitting here.~
LookDesc:$
That's some of the nastiest sleaziest porn you've ever seen, and you've looked
at the stuff from the 2040s.  As you look closer though, you notice a small
CatCo logo in the corner. This, coupled with the phrase "Sleaze 6: For
Internal Use Only" makes you realize that the porn was just a clever cover-up.
