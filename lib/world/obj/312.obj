Name:	^mThe Mediator Hat^n
RoomDesc:$
An ugly, crumpled mess of ^mpurple ^nfelt and ^wwhite ^nstars lays here.~
LookDesc:$
In theory it may once have been a wizard's hat, a little silver glitter still
outling the faint remains of white stars among the faded purple felt of its
floppy, semi-conical shape.  A few words in magic marker denote the front,
saying in a black barely visible amidstt the purple, "Big Ugly Mediator Hat."

A rusty barbecue grill stands here.~
LookDesc:$
A rusty old barbecue grill stands here on wobbly legs that could be rolled one
way or another if one of the wheels wasn't broken.  It's got that backyard

encrusted with the remains of hamburges, sausage and who knows what else.
