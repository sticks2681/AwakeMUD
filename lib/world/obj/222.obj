	Keywords:	EGG
	Desc:$
The Egg itself. Your main goal.  It is said to be hidden deep within the
wolves' extensive underground burrow.  This wolf pack is one of the largest
known, and is extremely hostile. Again, hidden within the forest, but not
difficult to reach, if you know where to go, which unfortunately, we can give
no hints on, as we are not entirely sure ourselves. It is said that the way
the wolves acquired the egg is via a hidden passage to the dragon's den from
deep within their home. For you to acquire this egg, be prepare to squeeze
through dark, cramped corridors. It will be impossible to stay together
without communication. The eldest of wolves is said to guard this egg.  He is
also said to be incredibly brutal, with unimaginable strength.  Be wary,
shadowrunners.  This is no game.

	Keywords:	DRAGON
	Desc:$
The dragon's lair is hidden well within the rough terrain, and without
sufficiant skills, you may die attempting to reach him. This particular dragon
is very much hostile to humanoid beings, due to things in his past, and the
fact that he is constantly hassled by their kind. It is a very obvious reason
why he wants the Egg: it is his kin. Not particular on asking for help, the
only reason he hasn't retrieved the egg himself, is because of the location
where it is being held; it would be impossible for a dragon to retreive it.
Dragons are not keen on sharing their loot, and he may in fact, kill you, even
if you have delivered the egg safely into his care. If this Egg does hatch
into a dragon in his care, it is almost certain they together will wreak havoc
upon humankind.  But, it is up to you, shadowrunner. If you do choose this
path, I highly suggest swimming experience, or climbing experience,
preferabbly very much of both.

	Keywords:	MILITARY
	Desc:$
The military is located within the wilderness, and will fairly difficult to
reach.  Once inside, depending on the information you have received, and
decisions you have made, they may or may not be hostile.  Chances are, they
will. It is a very well-kept secret that they capture all different races of
creatures, and dissect them, only to reassemble them to create Super Soldiers.
They may or may not want the Dragon Egg for that purpose. Within the walls,
they also do genetic research, and cloning.  That is another possibility.  It
is left up to you, shadowrunner. The military obviously would have more funds
than a dragon, and would be alot more likely to give you some, IF you give
them what they want in return. If you do choose this path, you will need to
locate a man named Gelinske.
