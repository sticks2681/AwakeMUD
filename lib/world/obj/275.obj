At first glance, it's just a little box that doesn't do anything.  On closer
inspection, however, you can see various small probes sticking out of it.  It
is also sending out small encrypted packets of data.  If you had to guess,
it's some type of monitoring equipment.  It seems this bank doesn't want
people like you poking around.  You might want to head out, chummer.  You
never know where that data's going--or who might be looking at it right now.
