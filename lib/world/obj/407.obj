This credstick is unlike any standard credstick in the UCAS or Tir Tairngire.
Unlike being made of a steel, plastic, silver, titanium or emerald color, It
is made of a very hard plastic, completely black in color, with a polish.
Because of their high price and security, everyone know's when you pull this
badboy out that you are indeed "The Man."
