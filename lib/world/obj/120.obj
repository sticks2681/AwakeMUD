RoomDesc:$
A massive weeping willow tree dominates the area here.~
LookDesc:$
This tree is simply massive, and is easily recognized as a weeping willow by
its distinctive long, graceful branches that sweep toward the ground. The
branches and twigs themselves are thin, almost rope-like, and sway even in the
lightest of breezes. Its lance-shaped leaves are a yellowish-green on their
tops, and a milky green on their undersides, measuring roughly six inches or
so each. It extends out and above an area roughly fifty feet across and
stretches out into the sky just as high. A set of rope ladders and scaffolding
have been constructed onto the main trunk itself, lending a bit of strength to
their design.

RoomDesc:$
A bullpup SMG with a top-mounted clear plastic magazine is resting here.~
LookDesc:$
This original submachine gun was built for military use and is illegal in the
civilian sector. Its construction was preciptated by the observation that
about two-thirds of an army - vehicle crews, officers, cooks, and other
support personnel - didn't carry a rifle, nor did they need to. This bullpup
SMG was devised to arm them.
 This particular model comes with an assault sling, a nylon belt that holds it
in a ready position across the user's chest. It also features an integrated
laser sight and day/night magnifaction scope, and includes rails to add
additional accessories without compromising the integrated features.
