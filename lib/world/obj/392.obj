A highly polished broadsword of some type has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
Tsurugi is a Japanese word used to refer to any type of straight, double-edged
broadsword, much different in appearance to the traditional katana. While no
longer in common use, this sword is more than capable of delivering fatal
wounds that would make the revered katana green with envy.

This ultra-violet light reactive mini-skirt is a must for the raver club

Six different buckles are placed around two straps around the waist for a
secure fit, which is a bit redundant considering its appearance.

RoomDesc:$
A flute of some kind with multiple tubes has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
The pan flute (or pan pipe) is an ancient musical instrument based on a closed
tube design, usually with five or more pipes of gradually increasing length.
The flute is named after the Greek god Pan, and as such is a popular folk
instrument. It is considered the first mouth organ, ancestor of both the pipe
organ and the harmonica. This particular model has passed up the traditional
wood in favour of a bamboo construction, and is adorned in a classy manner
with an ornate leather and silver strand binding.

^gA brightly polished ^ybrass^g trombone has been left here.^N~
LookDesc:$
The trombone was developed from the trumpet. The name trombone is from Italian
and means "big trumpet", and has not changed much since its invention. It has
9 feet of tubing and a cylindrical bore, with seven playing positions on the
slide. The slide itself is made from one tube tightly fitted over another.
Notes are produced by changing the length of the tubing, which is accomplished
by changing the position of the slide. Higher pitches, on the other hand, are
achieved by changing the pressure of ones breath.

An old, classical lyre crafted from carbon fiber is sitting here.~
LookDesc:$
The lyre is a string musical instrument well known for its use in classical
antiquity. And while it may appear to be a harp, it is played by being
strummed, much like a guitar, rather than plucked like a harp.This particular
instrument follows its classical design, but with a modern twist in materials
used in its construction, namely its exchange of wood in favour of sturdier
and longer lasting carbon fiber.

LookDesc:$
This particular mandolin is crafted from synthetic wood and is stained a dark
reddish brown colour, and features a traditional oval sound hole. Its small
size and higher pitch make mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed
instruments like the guitar, which encourages the use of tremolo (rapid
picking of one or more pairs of strings) to create sustained notes or chords.
