A pair of sneakers sit here, stealthy!~
LookDesc:$
These sneakers are based on the retro-trend of last year. Although the corps
managed to almost redesign the original Converse design, crucial details were
left out. You also don't remember so many logo's..

RoomDesc:$
Some really strange boots sit all by their lonesome here.~
LookDesc:$
Well, these boots look like they started out as a normal pair of combat boots.
Then some nutcase came along and thought it'd be cute to glue on pink fur all
over them except for the soles.

RoomDesc:$
A pair of lonely boots sit here.~
LookDesc:$
These boots don't have much in the way of personality, aside from looking
hardcore. If a clothes designer could made boots that look like they were made
to kick more ass, you'd probably want them. To add to the effect, these boots
look like they've already done some ass-kicking, testifying to it with several
scuffs.

A LONG pair of boots sit here.~
LookDesc:$
These boots look like the type a pirate wanna-be would wear. Made from what
looks and smells like synth-leather, they've been worn in pretty well and
sport a nice tan color. On a normal sized 'runner, they would reach the knee
(trolls and dwarves optional .)

The retro-style returned in flux two years ago, but now that it's out the
jackets have become a lot cheaper. You'll still look suave in this jacket.
There's still a pin stuck in the left breast, advertising a band you've never
heard of before.
