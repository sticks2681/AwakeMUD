RoomDesc:$
Something has been left here. It looks like a pendant.~

The glossy object is a small spider enclosed in some semi-transparent
material. The spider seems still vivid and moving, kept floating within the
bubble like without any garvity! Strange powers must be working within...

RoomDesc:$
A glass of clear water (fresh as the spring) has been left here.~

Even the glass has a logo on it- in detailed colors the Fed Boeing emblem is
fixed to it. But if they claim for just one glass such a lot, maybe you also

RoomDesc:$
A bagel filled with BLT has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
If one ain't hungry enough- maybe it just has already seen to much time
passing by. At least this isn't the bagel you have been waiting for. If you
are trying not to die of starvation, maybe you can try to force it down. And
the next problem: keep it inside your stomach. At least it doesn't run away...

RoomDesc:$
A burger is lying on a lake formed by pure grease. Enjoy!~

You can't actually make out any meat in the damn thing, because the grease
has shaped the burger itself. If there is any meat in there anyway, don't
count on it being your prime Texan cow either.
