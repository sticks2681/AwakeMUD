Long, and made of soft, smooth, black leather, it contains the ^L{^ri^L}^cI^rT^c^T^n logo on

completely blocks out all regular visuals of the face, and has plenty of room
underneath for glasses or small radio equipment. On the forehead of the mask
is the word ^RDEATH DEALER^n wrote in what appears to be blood. It has no Odor.
