A plain leather wallet is lying here~
LookDesc:$
This is a rather nondescript leather wallet. It opens on the side and is
designed for an earlier era when using paper for monetary transactions was
norm, It has a small pocket inside for holding little objects and a small
plastic insert for holding prictures. How the heck your gonna get a hologram
in there is another puzzle altogether.
