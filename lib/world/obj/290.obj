The Heckler und Koch MP-5 submachine gun is one of the most famous and
wide-spread firearms of its class, having been developed since the Second
World War. Its development began circa 1964 under the company designation HK
MP-54, or simply HK 54. Multiple improvements have been made over the time
since its development, including concerns over reliability with its magazines,
as well as having their trigger units upgraded. The MP-5, basically, is no
more than the scaled-down version of the H&K G3 battle rifle. It shares the
same basic design with a stamped steel receiver and the same roller-delayed
blowback action, derived from the post-war CETME rifles. This particular model
has been customized, and features an integral barrel silencer and
magnification scope.
