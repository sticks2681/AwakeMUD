Aside from being completely unmarked and the fact that it's ^Ljet-black^n, there
is nothing remarkable about this suit of medium security armor. It provides
adequate protection sporting fitted plates over a padded under-suit to insure
both ballistic and impact protection for its wearer.

Unmarked and jet-black are the only features of this security helmet that
stand out, which one can only assume, is exactly the point. Providing a little
added protection while still remaining discreet, this helmet also does an
adequate job of helping to conceal its wearer's identity.

The M.O.R.P (Mobile Operations Readiness Pack) bases its design on the
Blackhawk X-3 R.A.P.T.O.R. In fact, the same manufacturer produces these packs
as a custom product for Blackwind Shipping; who need a pack for their
personnel that better suits their diverse needs. Blackwind agents enjoy these
packs because they are durable, lightweight, and distribute the weight carried
allowing the wearer to carry more load. The makers of Blackhawk have even
considered adding this line of packs to their own.
