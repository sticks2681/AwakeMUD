Name:	a cheap cigar
RoomDesc:$
A cheap cigar is smoldering away and giving off a bad stench here.~
LookDesc:$
Cigars usually smell much better then this, but the poor quality of the
tobacco is obvious by the foul stench this one is giving off. Just a sniff of
the paper might make you wonder if it had been rolled with used toilet paper
rather then cigar wrapping.
