Name:	stylish, white designer slacks
RoomDesc:$
A pair of stylish, white designer slacks lie neatly folded here.~
LookDesc:$
Made from the finest linen, these slacks look like they were imported from a
country that really cares about the design in their textiles.  They look very
expensive as well.  Examining the inside of the slacks you see a small label
with some odd characters on it that one might recognize as Sperethiel, the
elven language.
