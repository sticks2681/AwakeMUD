RoomDesc:$
A large desk stands here.~
LookDesc:$
The desk spans half of the room, giving the guard enough space to really
stretch out. It's painted a strange hue of green, hardly the nicest colour
to shove on a desk in a reception, but that's corporations for you.

The RP-930 is one of Parell's most prized and coveted creations, and is
available only to their most prized customers. A genuine piece of gunsmithing
art, this pistol is light and small enough to pass for a normal pop-gun, but
can drill through almost any usual armour with the ease of a specialized
Ingram.
