LookDesc:$
This tank is constructed out of thick plexiglass and has only a few small
ornamentations upon it, most of which are lined along its edges. It looks
large enough to accomodate atleast two very large humans, and is used for
baptismal services given by the Reverend, which are in high demand given the
following hes accumulated. The water smells heavily of bleach, and it stings
ones eyes just leaning over to look into it. Something tells you it probably
wouldn't taste all that great either.. and as to why one would want to
actually drink something various people have had their bodies in (Eww..),
thats an even greater mystery than why people would want to be baptised by a
bigot priest.

^WHumanis^N: ^BFor a Better Future^N. The condition of goblinization, or
^WUnexplained Genetic Expression^N first appeared in 2011. Victims with the
latent genes underwent painful and disgusting physical changes as a result.
It is a ^rsexually transmitted disease^N that is always passed on to the
offspring of an afflicted parent. The associated physical mutations range
from an abundance or lack of body mass, malformed ears and teeth, subdermal
and transdermal growths, and a number of other horrifying side-effects. This
disease has run rampant, infecting millions world-wide. ^RNo precautions are
being taken to check the spread of this horrible disease^N. The afflicted need
to be quarantined in order to prevent further spread of this plague. It is for
the purpose of funding research into a cure for this socially debilitating
disease that the ^WHumanis^N exists. The other primary function of our group
is to lobby governments and corporations for interim measures to contain the
spread of the problem until such a cure can be found. Our organization ^rdoes not
sanction violence^N, nor will any of members use violence except in self-defense.
Anything to the contrary is slander spread by misguided, far-left political groups
who have been seduced by the power and intimidation their disease brings them.
Your donations will gladly be accepted by the collection plate or via the Matrix.
