a plan that mortals really shouldn't see lies here (REPORT IT!)~
LookDesc:$
Ok, ideas :
 ^W*^n - ^W3^n types of guard: ^B1^n/ Shop guard - sentinel, stays in the one shop. Normal
mall guard attribs (maybe stronger as these days all chars start with more
attrib points - so stronger newbies, hopefully only newbies will attack). ^R2^n/
Mall Gaurd - These will again be like shop guards, only wandering but still
Stay_zone. ^G3^n/ Guard Seargeant - Better attribs, wanders around, bit more
uniform, but again not impossible to newbies or those hovering around the 16
rep mark).
 ^W*^n - Back rooms for shops. Not easily accessible - maybe keycard on a cleaner
(will HAVE TO HAVE cleaners, this is meant to be a well-maintained mall - so
plenty of cleaners polishing the floors etc.) which you then get to from a
cleaners room accessible from the underground carpark. Will be VERY
convoluted.
 ^W*^n - Maybe only one level. Current ideas - some trendy fashion company, Pawn
shop, Pharmacy (patches and stuff), Oxfam (it's traditional but more stuff),
Sport supply store (I don't THINK there's anywhere else to get the remington
5-bullet magazines outside the newbie guild - or the guns themselves), Army
Bargains (canteens, ration bars, combat trousers, boots etc), knacker-tracker
sports store (sorry, just a home thing - sells stuff like trainers, adidas
(will rename) tracksuits etc), a music store (not jilted), Cyberstore (maybe
subchain on the one in Aztech?), a Cafe (maybe 2), a Modern Magick (overpriced
given what it'll sell - not unexpected for Tacoma), Survival shop (like army
bargains except more expensive, and might offer more equipment - like knives
and stuff), Trixshack (like a sorta Net cafe), kevlar armor, plus a guarded
ATM and a security center (which might be raided for equipment) - also will be
cornershops. Plus also, just suggested, bakers and jewelers.
