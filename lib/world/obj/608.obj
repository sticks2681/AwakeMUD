RoomDesc:$
A delapidated 2040-edition BMW roadster.~
LookDesc:$
Once on the cutting-edge of the automotive industry with its patented fluidics
and design, this rusty hulk now sits, squalid and sinister, long-forgotten by
its owners. The techno vultures have come and gone, stripping this
once-beautiful car of nearly everything remotely of value, leaving a metallic
skeletal remain.
