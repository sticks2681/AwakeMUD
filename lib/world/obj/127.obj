Name:	a cheaply encrypted datafile
RoomDesc:$
A cheap looking little datafile has been left behind here.~
LookDesc:$
The datafile itself has a low-end encryption on it, but nothing any two-bit
hacker worth their salt would break a sweat over ripping through. It seems to
contain random bits of information, mostly to do with quarterly profits broken
down into branch divisions based on regional location. Handy bit of info, for
the right person.
