This vast selection of tables consist of various types and sizes, ranging from

you overlook all the scratches and scuffs from abuse. Just to be on the safe

"The Solution". Its handle has been wrapped and re-wrapped and then duct
taped, giving it a solid grip for swinging. It's safe to say that if you have

being an actual person. The smell, however, coming off of this thing, gives
the impression that it was at one point (quite some time ago), alive and
kicking. The fact that it's wearing a rival go-gangs colours tends to lend
credence to this being some poor slag who was on the wrong end of a beating.

An old length of steel rebar has been tossed aside as garbage here.~
LookDesc:$
While most commonly used as a tensioning device in reinforced concrete
construction, these ridged carbon steel rods work wonderfully as improvised
weapons in the hands of those less well off. It was most likely ripped out of
an old, gutted building, as indicated by some of the rust spots spreading
along its battered and dented length.

been mended to keep from having their bottoms fall out under the weight of the
pool balls being knocked into them. None of that automated crap, you gotta
retrieve the balls from the pocket when you wanna rack up a new game.

This variant on the Bloody Mary is made out of dark rum instead of vodka,
tomato juice, a dash of Worcestershire and a small splash of habanero as
opposed to tabasco for a bit more heat. A lonely stalk of celery is stuck
inside of the concoction served in a highball glass.

Said (by the supposed inventor who happens to work here) to be the grittiest
thing this side of a Devil Rat's own piss, this cocktail combines various
synthetic alcohols with sweet mixers so that while it may look like something
that would be served in the dingiest of bars in the barrens it still has a
delightful taste. The cocktail is served in a glass that is specially designed
to look dingy and dirty, part of the enhanced ambiance of the surroundings. A
must have for the street punk poser.

another slightly different shade of black. Everyone will know you totally
don't support those mainstream capitalist corporations when you've got a
Schlitz in your hand, leaving you free to use those minutes you would have
wasted explaining how non-conformist you are so you can hand out fliers for
your shitty garage band instead.

An economic and safer alternative for practicing with a sword is to use a

Europeon arming sword and is weighted to match its real counterpart. The edge
of the 'blade' is rounded and sanded smooth to make it blunt, which also helps
to make it more durable since sword practice often consists of striking
things.

The shinai is a Japanese weapon used in practice and in competition in the

flex and compact together to spread out the force of the blow, significantly
reducing the likelihood of injury.

RoomDesc:$
A hideous black tusk is rocking around on the floor.~
LookDesc:$
This tusk was probably better off being pulled out of the poor fraggers face
it originally belonged to. It is almost entirely rotten and is almost black in
colour from having never been brushed in its terribly short lifetime.

The Novatech insignia is emblazoned proudly along the wide outer "bi-cep" of
this vaguely mechanical humanoid limb. It's much larger, and clearly much
sturdier than any normal limb, and perhaps even moreso than most cyber
versions as well. Considering how bulky and oversized it is, not to mention
its model designation, it's been geared entirely towards vastly increasing the
users physical strength, mostly at cost of flexibility and limberness. It's
being stored in a thick, clear tubular glass shipping case so it can be shown
off without being removed from its vessel.
