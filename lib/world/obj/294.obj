RoomDesc:$
^gAn assault rifle constructed from ^Lblack polymers^g has been left here.^N~
LookDesc:$
The KRISS Vector CRB/SO self-loading carbine is a derivative of the Kriss
Super V(TM) submachine gun, which was developed around the turn of the last
century in USA by Transformational Defense Industries, Inc. (TDI). This
fully-automatic carbine utilizes the patented Super V(TM) operating system
with a light bolt that is connected to a vertically sliding weight. According
to the manufacturer, this system decreases felt recoil and minimizes muzzle
jump for its caliber of choice, the .45 ACP round, thus allowing for fast and
accurate follow-up shots. It is crafted from lightweight black polymers and
features a 30-round magazine, with a side-folding polymer buttstock to provide
for more accurate shooting.

An old rusted shovel has been left here, waiting to be put to use.~
LookDesc:$
This heavy duty shovel is quite old, as the rust upon its metal components
attests to. Its thick wooden shaft showcases stress cracks and small splinters
along its length, having been thoroughly used in its lifetime. Dried dirt and
mud are caked onto it, and its metal handle wobbles a little, obviously
needing to be refitted. It features a wide, flat edge, making it a great
choice for digging graves.

from the constant down pour of rain mixed with dirt. Oddly enough, even as old

so much as a single crack or chip, or any sort of dirt or mud upon its
