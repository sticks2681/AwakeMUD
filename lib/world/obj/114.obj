Choco Taco is a brand of dessert food resembling a taco, consisting of a taco
shell-like waffle cone, reduced-fat vanilla ice cream, artificially flavored
fudge, peanuts, and a milk chocolate coating. The product was invented in
Philadelphia in the 1980s by the Jack and Jill Ice Cream Company, but was
introduced nationwide by Good Humor-Breyers in 1996 as "America's coolest
taco", at the Supermarket Industry Convention in Chicago, Illinois. Now that
you've read the cheesy back-story on the wrapper, why don't you open it up and
indulge in the finest combination of ice cream and faux-mexican food ever
assembled by mortal men? It's the best!

need a platter to be served on instead of the regular large dinner plates
available at Rokhalla. A mass of dough, rendered almost unrecognizable beneath
the thick white glaze that dribbled down along the dappled flesh, leaving
large bits of cinnamon visible. Yes, cinnamon, the smell is almost arousing to
those who have had the dish before, and because it's bigger, it must be better
right? Easily two and a half kilos, this mountain of a dessert is created
lovingly and with the kind of skill that one would expect from a mother or
grandmother, transformed into a monstrosity that could sate the hunger of even
a starving, pregnant Troll woman with the right accoutremonts.

expensive than your average soy ham and cheese from the stuffer shack, but you
definitely get what you pay for. Soy substitute meats are available, though
the true excellence of the sandwich is that the hall offers meat, meat that
used to belong to an animal since, as everyone knows, murder makes it taste
better, lovingly piled on with whatever kind of condiments one could imagine
between the bread of your choosing. There are no small portions, these
sandwiches only come in one size, and that is "Big enough to club someone over
the head with and steal their wallet while they bleed out in a gutter" size.

Name:	A large, superbly-crafted viking long sword
RoomDesc:$
A heavy sword has been left here, its blade offering a faint glint from the light that catches it.~
LookDesc:$
This weapon, to many, typifies viking warriors and the rough, powerful legacy
they left in their wake. It bears no ornate etchings or engravings, there are
no precious gems or metals that mark it as a work of art, and yet the way it
is crafted seems to speak for itself. Its sheer size makes this weapon seem
unsuitable for anyone short of a Troll to use, the thick, slightly tapered
blade possessing a single wide fuller that travels around three quarters of
its length, reinforcing it for more powerful strikes while helping to cut
down, however slightly, on its great weight. The guard is simple, again,
without ornamentation, and subtly upswept to protect the rather large hand
meant to wield it, while the grip is wrapped in special synthleather that
resists moisture. The pommel is shaped like the head of Mjolnir to those
well-versed in Norse mythos, though otherwise appears somewhat standard for
this type of weapon.

Known by historians as the weapon of the viking elite, this weapon is more
versatile than many would give it credit for, and this example of the weapon
looks to live up to that reputation easily. It is rather simple, a heavy, real
wooden haft that looks more like a small tree than a true axe handle, shaped
carefully to fit into a large metahuman's hands as ergonomically as possible
while retaining enough heft to be used as a staff should the heavy blade at
one end not be required, all wrapped beneath rough rawhide to ensure an
unfailing grip. The head of the axe possesses a pronounced beard, its edge
exquisitely sharp and while it looks to have been crafted by someone who
values functionality or fashion, it still can't help but lower a few jaws due
to its sheer size.

In comparison to its heavier and more bitter chief competitors, Guinness and
Beamish, Murphy's is a lighter and sweeter dry stout. Its flavour is evocative
of caramel and malt, and is described as "a distant relative of chocolate
milk". The resemblance to milk extends beyond flavour to texture; Murphy's is
free from any hint of carbonation, and is delivered "black as strong
cappuccino" with an inch of foam "the head" on top. The head, in particular,
is lauded for its remarkably thick and creamy nature and its "spoonable"
density.
