Name:	a simple, polished synthwood bar
RoomDesc:$
A simple, polished synthwood bar to serve customers is here.~
LookDesc:$
Crafted from a cheap synthwood blend, it is sturdy enough to hold up against
the rigors of servers and drunkards alike. Polished to a high sheen and
featuring grooves in its surface to keep glasses from sliding off of it, any
bar that cannot afford one of these doesn't deserve to be called one.

Name:	a southwestern style grilled chicken salad
RoomDesc:$
A bowl of grilled chicken salad has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
This salad consists of an amalgamation of sweet corn and black beans cooked in
a sauce of cider vinegar, sugar, freshly chopped cilantro, chili powder, a
dash of cayenne pepper, and ofcourse, salt and pepper to taste. Combined with
slender slices of perfectly grilled chicken rubbed lightly with onion powder,
chili powder, black pepper, garlic powder, a little bit of cumin and cayenne
pepper have been tossed with various species of fresh, crisp salad leaves.
Pouring a dressing of any kind is an insult to the blend of flavours this
salad contains.

A hefty serving of grilled beef brisket is here.~
LookDesc:$
Rubbed with onion powder, chipotle peppers, black pepper, oregano, cumin,
garlic powder and a dash of netmeg, this beef brisket is then basted with beer
and slowly grilled for nearly four hours. The end result is a beautifully
charred surface and a perfectly cooked center, whose meat is so succulent and
tender that it nearly falls off the bone just from gravity alone. Due to its
flavour packed rub, it needs absolutely no sauce, which would do nothing but
subtract from the taste of its natural juices.

A nice salmon fillet has been grilled with its skin still intact, which helps
not only to retain its moisture during the cooking process, but also adds
flavour to the dish. Lightly sprinkled with both salt and pepper, and grilled
with a layer of lemon slices, rosemary and sage leaves, as well as a few pats
of butter, which seep together in a nicely balanced sensation of flavours.
Removed from the heat when it is still a little undercooked, the retained heat
continues to cook it to perfection on its way to the customer.

While it is crafted from dyed synthetic leather, it does look pretty real,
especially in comparison to most synthleather jackets on the market these
days. It has seen its fair share of wear and tear, but has held up through it
all with just a few scuffs and scrapes to tell the tale. It is almost
floor-length, with an open front lacking buttons or ties, and is pretty hefty
for something its size. Its sleeves have been rolled up, and it seems near
impossible to unroll them again. Weird. Feeling its lining gives the tell tale
impression it has some sort of kevlar weave, and maybe even a few flexible
plates in particularly vulnerable spots, offering quite a bit of protection.

RoomDesc:$
A nasty looking vibroknife is laying here.~
LookDesc:$
The vibroknife, like it's bigger twin the vibrosword, has a well earned
reputation on the streets as a vicious close combat weapon. Its serrated
blades vibrate at a rate of more than twenty times a second, acting like a saw
as it chews through both armour and flesh alike with ease. Sturdy double-sided
hand guards keep fingers from getting sliced off, and its thick handle offers
a sturdy grip when being swung around, which also doubles as a battery
housing. Stealth is not a function this weapon recognizes, as once it is
activated, it emits a very audible hum due to its vibration.

This wooden club is almost as thick as a human thigh, and features countless
dents and bruising from constant use. Its handle has been carved down almost
to a baseball bat like appearance, which has been wrapped in old leather for a
sure grip. A simple leather thong is nailed into its end, which is used to
hang around ones wrist so it doesn't accidentally going flying off when you're

This very large, very thick ^Lblack leather^N trenchcoat is way too large for all

dentiplast, extending out from which are multiple ^csteel^N spikes. It seems to be
made from real leather, but it is scuffed and scraped so badly that it has
lost almost all value it once held. It is lined with a thick layer of kevlar
