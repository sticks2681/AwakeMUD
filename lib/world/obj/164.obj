mold themselves into finger rings, while the dragons jaw is slightly ajar,
teeth sunk deeply into the tip of the tail as they meet above the thumb.

One of the truths of close quarter combat is that a rifle, shotgun or musket

American Indians in the early 16th century observed these facts and wasted no
time in fashioning their own gunstock war clubs, which were made of straight
grain hard woods. This one in particular is fashioned from a single beautiful
piece of black ash, while its 'edge' has been fire treated and narrowed like
an axe blade, and sports a single silver lance point at the point of its outer
curve for an extra punch. Its classic 'fawns foot' handle supplies the wielder
with a sturdy, reliable grip when smashing in their enemies skulls.

Name:	a large and heavy bladed nagamaki
RoomDesc:$
A large and deadly looking nagamaki has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
The nagamaki's katana-like blade has a single-edge, but is straighter and
thinner. The spine is beveled along its back edge to reduce weight, and a long
bloodgroove has been inlaid with orichalcum. It resembles a traditional
naginata, but the main difference is that the handle of the nagamaki is not
constructed of wood, but instead wrapped tightly with cords in criss-crossed
manner, very similar to the wrapping that is made on a katana.

Name:	a massive ceremonial zweihander
RoomDesc:$
A highly ornate two-handed sword lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The Zweihander, or 'two-hander' was implemented in Germany in the 14th
century, and gained renown during the 16th century as the hallmark weapon of
the German Landsknechts from the time of Maximilian I. Its long, heavy blade
makes it an ideal sword for dealing with pikemen and spearmen, and able to
cleave a man in half with a single swing. The sword has hilt-mounted
side-rings and an ornately enlarged cross-guard, while just above it are
parrying hooks shaped like lugs to help prevent other weapons from sliding
down the blade.

A telescoping staff covered in mystical designs lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This telescoping staff is a modified version of one of the oldest weapons
known to man, and is still quite effective when placed in the hands of a
talented wielder. The casing of the staff is lined with various runes and
designs, both hermetic and shamanic in nature, intertwining with one another
as they cover its surface. The staff stretches to over two meters long when
fully extended and locked in place.

A hefty looking club lined with spikes lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This massive sliver of dark hardwood is over two meters long, and is as thick
as a mans forearm. Its tapered shaft widens as it travels up to its
octagonally hewn upper haft that covers the top third of the war club, which
is wrapped with thick metal bands that are lined with nasty two inch long
spikes upon each of their sides. Six rows of eight spikes, counting one at
each tip, adds up to fifty spikes, more than enough to leave your enemies
broken corpses at your feet.

A three-section white oak staff lies bound up here.~

This weapon is traditionally crafted from three sturdy white oak sticks, the
slightly shorter pair of them connected at both ends of the larger by a few
inches of chain rings. A few markings blemish its smooth white construction,
but for the most part the weapons surface is bare, showing off its beautiful
wood grain patterning.

This massive double-bladed battleaxe measures over two meters in length, most
of which is a sturdy hardwood shaft wrapped tightly with strips of black
leather for an infallible grip. Its dual curved blades resemble a large
cleaver in their design and are adorned with orichalcum accents. Embedded in
the center of the single piece axe head is a fist-sized, smoothly polished orb
of bloodstone, green jasper dotted with bright red spots of iron oxide.
