RoomDesc:$
A bullet-riddled trideo system is set up here.~
LookDesc:$
This trideo set has seen better days, certainly. It doesn't seem to be
functional anymore, considering its riddled with bullets, its screen has been
smashed out, and the power cord has been yanked out of its base, leaving
behind frizzled copper wires. The set jingles with shattered glass every time
its moved, which occasionally spills out the front.

Its a standard wooden table, covered in a sticky residue, most likely from

newspapers have been spread out across its length in an attempt to keep the
surface managable, but all it really ends up doing is making the newspaper
just as messy, which rips and tears off every time something is set down and
picked up.
