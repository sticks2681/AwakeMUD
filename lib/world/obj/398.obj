Name:	A Heckler and Koch USP P12 Heavy Pistol
RoomDesc:$
A sleek, ^Lblack^N heavy pistol sits on the floor.~
LookDesc:$
The USP Tactical was everything that the military wanted in an offensive
handgun, but without the cumbersome size.  The only real difference between a
Tactical and a standard USP45 is the adjustable sights, extended barrel with
threads and O-ring, and a match trigger.  Capable of considerable accuracy in
its own right, the Tactical was soon the preferred choice of the very special
operations units that were to be issued the SOCOM.

Nearly everyone thinks of garnet as a red gem. In fact, this family of
gemstones is available in all colors except blue. Garnets offer enough variety
in appearance to suit every taste. There are many ancient traditions and
legends about garnets. Some Hebrew writers include it as one of the 12 gems in
Aarons breastplate. Christian tradition long considered the blood-red garnet
symbolic of Christ's sacrifice. The Koran holds that it illuminates the Fourth
Heaven of the Moslems. Garnet was said to give its wearer guidance in the
night allowing him to see when others couldnt. Legend claims that Noah hung a
large garnet in the ark for illumination. According to the Egyptians, garnet
is an antidote for snakebite and food poisoning.

Amethyst is a variety of quartz, ideally deep medium purple with rose-colored

ancient Greeks believed that whoever wore an amethyst or drank from an
amethyst chalice would not fall victim to intoxication. It is also said to
have a sobering effect on those over-excited by loves passion. It has
symbolized peace, protection and tranquility. Some say it will prevent
baldness and improve complexion, while protecting from treason and deceit.
Because royalty has always adored the color purple, amethysts abound in the
ornaments of ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and in the British Crown Jewels.

The ideal color of aquamarine is a refreshing sea blue. If you are looking for
a big, durable gemstone, aqua is readily available in larger sizes and is
truly dramatic when cut in rectangular or oval shapes. It is a member of the
important beryl family, which also includes emerald. Derived from the Latin
meaning sea water, aquamarine was said to aid seafarers; thus it makes an
excellent gift for sailors or those who travel frequently by sea. To dream of
aquamarine signifies the making of new friends. To wear aquamarine brings love
and affection. They are thought to give the wearers knowledge, foresight and
assist in an individual's inspiration. It is a universal symbol of youth,
fidelity, hope and health.

Even though the diamond is the hardest of all gemstones known to man, it is
the simplest in composition: it is common carbon. The ancient Greeks believed
that diamonds were splinters of stars fallen to earth. It was even said by
some that they were the tears of the Gods or perhaps crystallized lightning or
hardened dew drops. The truth is, however, that the exact origin of diamonds
is still something of a mystery, even to scientists and geologists. In ancient
times only kings wore diamonds as a symbol of strength, courage and
invincibility. Over the centuries, the diamond acquired its unique status as
the ultimate gift of love. It was said that Cupids arrows were tipped with
diamonds which have a magic that nothing else can ever quite equal. But it
wasnt until 1477, when Archduke Maximillian of Austria gave a diamond ring to
Mary of Burgundy, that the tradition of diamond engagement rings began. Even
the reason a woman wears it on the third finger of her left hand dates back to
the early Egyptian belief that the vena amoris (vein of love) ran directly
from the heart to the top of the third finger, left hand.

The emerald is known as the Queen of Gems, and the gem of queens. The most
prized is pure green or slightly bluish green. Emeralds are often
characterized by a garden of included crystals trapped within. Under
magnification, you will see all sorts of lovely patterns resembling foliage in
a garden. A flawless, clear emerald is very rare and is usually found in only
small sizes. Small to medium sized stones are often faceted in the step or
emerald cut. The gem is also lovely when cut into a cabochon or dome shape.
Sometimes emeralds are even carved. The ancients held the emerald in great
esteem, believing they sharpened the wearers eyesight and mind. The earliest
engravers kept emeralds on their work tables to gaze upon from time to time to
rest their tired eyes. Travelers relied on emeralds as protection against the
hazards and perils of long journeys. The green gem was also said to give its
owner the power to predict the future.

A pearl is the product of an oysters defense mechanism. When a foreign
irritant is introduced naturally or by man (cultured), the oyster immediately
surrounds it with layers of a substance called nacre. This forms the exquisite
gemstone known as pearl. Pearls come in a wide range of colors from delicate
rose white to black. They should be relatively free from skin blemishes. The
more perfectly round the shape the better. The higher the luster or orient,
the more valuable the specimen. Besides the popular round shape, there are
stylish mabe (large hemispherical cultured pearls), fresh water (elongated in
interesting shapes and colors), and South Sea (large cultured pearls 10 mm and

modesty, chastity and purity. They have also come to symbolize a happy
marriage.

Name:	A silver ring with a single, magnificent ^Rruby^n
RoomDesc:$
A ^Rruby^N ring is sitting on the floor, shimmering in a ray of divine light.~
LookDesc:$
The ruby is so named because of its rich red color. The ruby is a very durable
gemstone; its hardness is surpassed only by the diamond. Large rubies are very
scarce and costly, worth more than 2 to 3 times a diamond of equal size and
quality. Rubies were thought to contain a glowing spark struck from the planet
Mars. Ancient lore held that the ruby was capable of curing illness and
reconciling lovers quarrels. Hindus referred to the ruby as The Lord of the
Gems, and believed its deep red color came from an inextinguishable fire which
was capable of boiling water. It is said that a person should never make faces
at a ruby in a museum, and never ignore it, for it was said to grow dull if
slighted or not worn or seen.

Peridot is sometimes referred to as an Evening Emerald because under
artificial light the stone glows as a brilliant green. Choice peridot is
transparent and its color varies from yellow green to brilliant light green.
Peridot is the child of volcanic action, crystals are sometimes combed from
the black sands of Hawaii. It is abundant and available in larger sizes. The
peridot symbolizes eloquence and persuasiveness; it was dedicated to St.
Bartholomew. Treasured peridots found their way into cathedrals during the
Crusades. Many legends state that peridot was considered a powerful amulet
against all evil, as well as a remedy for sinus problems. It is said that if
the gem was set in gold, it had the power to protect its wearer from terrors
of the night, fears and bad dreams. Peridots were especially favored by
pirates.

LookDesc:$
Sapphire, a variety of corundum, comes in all colors except red, with the most
popular being deep blue. Rare orange, pink and lavender varieties, along with
rich velvety blue are the most expensive. Like the ruby, its twin except for
color, the sapphire is second only to the diamond in hardness. Some ancient
writers claimed the Ten Commandments were written on sapphire. Ancient
marriage partners had great faith in the stone, believing it would not shine
if worn by the wicked or impure. They were reported to be an excellent
all-purpose medicine; an antidote against poison and having the power to stop
bleeding and cure disorders of the eye. Sapphires were considered to be so
powerful they continued to protect the original owner even after being sold.

A ^bblue topaz^N earring is sitting on the ground, not being worn.~
LookDesc:$
Most people think of topaz as a transparent golden yellow gemstone. However,
this gemstone also occurs colorless as well as orange-yellow, red, honey-brown
(dark sherry), light green, blue and pink. The name topaz is derived from the
Greek word meaning to shine and also implies fire. Orange-red Imperial topaz
and pink colors are rare and most valuable. The lore, magic and romance of
topaz goes back many thousands of years. It holds the distinction of being the
gemstone with the widest range of curative powers. Ancient Egyptians thought
its golden glow symbolized Ra, their sun god. The Greeks felt it gave them
strength. In addition, it supposedly cooled tempers, restored sanity, cured
asthma, relieved insomnia and even warded off sudden death. Topaz is said to
make its wearer invisible in times of emergency. It proved the loyalty of
associates by changing color in the presence of poison.
