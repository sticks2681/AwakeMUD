Hello, dear executive officers of CryoCo.! The staff here at the R&D skin
labs complex wishes you a very happy visit. Please feel free to wander the
premises, and don't hesitate just to ask one of the workers here if you
need help.
CryoCo. is comitted to creating the most innovative and usefull technology,
making a better life for us all through genetic engineering and old
fashion medical techniques. The Skinlabs were established nearly 4 years ago
to provide CryoCo. with the edge in the competetive Bioware market. Since
then, the labs have surpassed in the development of genetically farmed tissue
any of the wildest dreams of its founders. Already, it is projected that we
will have a fully operational biomechanoid in at most two months, and excite-
ment is simply ubiquitous. Using the superconducting synaptic bridge tech-
nology developed in our Japan branch, we have perfected the neural net path-
working necessary for the completion of our task. It is our sincere hope that
the first on-line biomechanoid will ba far superior to human beings, but be
almost identical to them. Already several prototypes have been tested, and
although several casualties resulted from their activation, we cleaned the
 entrails from our walls and started over again. We are confident that the
next attempt will result in a much more stable being.
Our marketing analysts have also suggested that our biomechanoids will sell
like flapjacks once implemented, serving as soldiers and mercenaries. Also,
the technology we have developed here has many practical applications to the
surge in popularity of modern bioware, which splices biologically enhanced
tissues with carefully engineered micromachinery. 
All of us here at the Skinlabs wish you a happy visit!
