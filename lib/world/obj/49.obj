This T-shirt is known to offend people due to its nude models covered in cows
blood so its not a shirt you want your mommy to see you in. On the back is the
original Skull and Cross Boners emblem of the Dwarves which is just a normal
skull and cross-bones except instead of cross-bones it is two penises with the
testicles on one end made to look like a regular bone and on the other end
there are of course the penis heads.
