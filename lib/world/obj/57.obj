Look for a file in the /root directory, called .trixter-929
and delete it.  Then run the scouring agent on this disk.
The scouring agent is the file called ./cleanit on the root
directory of this disk.  Your security has been compromised.
A patch for the server daemon for Archbase is also on this disk.
cd to archbase-1.15.3, then type 'make install' into your control
workstation.  All the source code is there, if you wish to audit
it.  That will keep folks like myself from cracking your security
via the archbase fork() exploit.
You have been 0wn3d.
