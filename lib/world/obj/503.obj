RoomDesc:$
A weird looking suit of form fitting armor has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
 An exoskeleton designed to fit a humanoid body. It's constructed out of a
mechanized undersuit coated in a titanium polymer, put together in such a way
that it covers everything from the neck down. An onboard computer can link up
to the matching helmet that goes with the suit to provide feedback information
from the suit as well as handle the suits built in features, such as the
cloaking device. As well, the suits articulation system has been heavily
enhanced so that the wearers movements and attacks are actually sped up beyond
a normal rate, much like a wired reflex system.

RoomDesc:$
A helmet with a matte black finish is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
This helmet is designed to be worn in conjunction with its related prototype
body armor. It looks very similiar to a full faced motorcycle helmet and has a
neck attachment to it. The two combined provide a feedback system for the body
with the helmets visor acting as a heads up display similiar to BattleTac
equipment. As well as the normal capabilities the helmet also has an infrared
overlay and vision magnification, plus it has a vehicle control port so it can
be used while piloting and driving.

silver buttons, subtle shoulderpads, a narrow waist and slightly flared
pant-legs. Those with an affinity for old music would find similarities
between it and the one Madonna wore in her "Express Yourself" video.

RoomDesc:$
A medium sized pistol has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
This is the prototype Ares Predator MEBS, or Maximum Efficiency Ballistic
Sidearm. It was thought to be still in design phases by Ares, but it would
appear someone leeched the design specifications and someone has decided to
make their own version of it. It's a fairly standard design, complete polymer
matte black casing to keep hidden in the dark and no metal firing pieces. It
holds an extended twenty four shot magazine that's linked to an autoreload
mechanism, allowing the pistol to fire in burst modes. It also comes with a
built in laser sight right under the muzzle and all standard mounting points
in full operation. It chambers nine millimeter rounds but still manages to
pack a heavy punch, even when silenced.
