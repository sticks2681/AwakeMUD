Keywords:	sword greatsword monofilament mercurial
Name:	a monofilament mercurial greatsword
RoomDesc:$
An enormous, heavy sword lies on the ground.~
LookDesc:$
A huge weapon, it looks like a sword but handles like an axe. Inside the heavy
steel blade is a slender channel filled with mercury. When swung, this mercury
flows from a bulb in the handle to fill the channel in the blade, making the
tip heavier and giving it a mighty, cleaving swing. Combined with its
monofilament edge, it is capable of ripping through just about any defense.

Keywords:	black epic katana apollyon one blade
Name:	Apollyon
RoomDesc:$
A katana of epic proportions stands, stuck in the ground, waiting...~
LookDesc:$
This is the One Blade - Apollyon. Forged in the black fires of the Shai Realm
by the Lord Supreme Shai himself, Apollyon cannot be destroyed. It cannot be
wielded by any who are not Shai, or at least equivalent to a Shai in power and
knowledge. In form, Apollyon is made like a katana, though it is much larger
than any normal weapon. Its handle is two feet long and made of pure black
onyx, embued by the Shai with their magic to make it harder than titanium.
Platinum studs show through the black leather wrapping that makes the stone
handle grippable. Its blade extends an incredible seven feet in length. It,
too, is black. The Shai forged this weapon from an alloy of Damascus steel,
orichalcum, and the metal that in the First Age was called Mithril. Forging in
the black fires in the heart of Mount Scardai, the center of the Shai Realm,
stained the weapon, blade and handle, a shade of black like the void of space.
