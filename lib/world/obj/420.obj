Name:	a Neon Lotus
RoomDesc:$
A cocktail glass with the Neon Lotus ensignia is here.~
LookDesc:$
This cocktail concoction is both expensive and exquisite, just like its
namesake. Small organisms with properties similar to fireflies populate the
drink, frequently changing color and glowing brighter with any movement. They
have a lifespan of less than 10 minutes after exposure to the cocktail,
dissolving and bubbling up like carbonation thereafter. While the organisms
are totally non-toxic the same cannot be said for the drink itself, rumor is
each neon lotus contains trace amounts of kamikaze, ecstasy, and other
designer drugs. This combination of chic organisms, designer drugs, and
alchohol make for quite an enjoyable (and addictive) time.
 ^cContains:^N 30ml Dry Vodka, 30ml Blueberry schnapps, Splash of cranberry juice,
Maraschino cherry

A deadly delicacy waits to be eaten.~
LookDesc:$
Eating fugu is an inexplicable and slightly perverse attraction. Tetrodoxin,
the deadly poison in each fugu fish, is over one thousand times deadlier than
cyanide. The amount of tetrodoxin in one fugu fish is enough to kill fifty
people, and even touching the skin inproperly can be fatal. With that being
said, it is renowned as the most delectable seafood on earth by the japanese.
While most popular in sushi, connessuirs will tell you mixing fugu testes and
hot sake is a high no chip can give you.
