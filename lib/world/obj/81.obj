LookDesc:$
This is an unmarked thunderbird, as far as you can tell.  It has extensive
gunshot and shelling marks on it, as well as a decimated portside, probably
the result of a launched missile.  Examining the interior shows that whatever
cargo that was carried has been ransacked or retrieved. Looks like some t-bird
jock bit the dust.
