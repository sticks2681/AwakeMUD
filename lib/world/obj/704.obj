Name:	an antique LeMat .44 revolver
RoomDesc:$
An antique revolver has been left on display here.~
LookDesc:$
The LeMat revolver was originally a .42 or .36 caliber cap & ball black powder
revolver invented by Dr. Jean Alexandre LeMat of New Orleans, which features a
rather unusual secondary 16 gauge smoothbore barrel. It saw service with the
armed forces of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil
War between 1861 and 1865. It has been updated to accept .44 caliber catridges
and modified into a top-break style revolver design, allowing it to be
reloaded much more quickly, as well as having been given a double action
firing mechanism. It appears to have been chromed senseless and features the
original weathered walnut grips.

An ornately stylized flanged knights mace is on display here.~
LookDesc:$
A beautiful weapon fit for a knight, this mace is one of the most recognized
forms of medieval arms of all time. It features six sweeping pierced flanges
upon its head, each of which is ornately decorated and stylized, perched atop
a robust hexagonal shaft of high tempered steel sectioned off in three pieces
with equally decorated and acid etched ^Wsilver^N bands. The balance and weight of
this brutal weapon allow it to be wielded with incredible agility and speed,
either one handed or gripped in both thanks to its elongated handle wrapped in
^Lblack leather^N, making it a truly classic example of the innovation and talent
the weapon smiths of the period it hails from.
