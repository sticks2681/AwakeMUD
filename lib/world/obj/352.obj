Name:	a semi-long white toga
RoomDesc:$
a toga is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
The toga is made out of a sheet-like material. Colored red from some ancient
berries, the arm holes are kinda of fadeing. There is also a built in belt
across the waist of the toga. Thinking this is ancient it is actually fairly
new with platic compartments on the inside.

Keywords:	schnapps bottle drinking mint peppermint leaf
Name:	a bottle of peppermint Schnapps
RoomDesc:$
A short, square drinking bottle marked with a mint leaf lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The bottle is short and squat, made to be drank from. The liquid inside is
very sweet and deceptively strong, flavored almost like a candy cane but with
a hidden kick like good vodka. Peppermint Schnapps is more for flavor than
alcohol, but with the drunkenness comes a mighty pain if you do drink that
much.
