RoomDesc:$
A plated security vest with a K-E logo on it lies here.~

A well put together security vest, with plates of metal linked in such a way
to allow flexibility, yet still protect one from bullets or blades, whichever

Keywords:	fountain large brick chlorinated water
Name:	a large brick fountain
RoomDesc:$
A large brick fountain sprays thickly chlorinated water about.~
LookDesc:$
You could probably bleach a black furred Night-One in this fountain, and have
him able to pull off a disguise as an albino Night-One.  The chlorine is that
thick.  It smells like pure Clorox being sprayed about.  One might deduce that
its even a higher chlorine content than a public swimming pool.  A sign says
"DO NOT DRINK - CITY OF PORTLAND, PRINCIPALITY OF TIR TAIRNGIRE" in English
and Sperethiel.

Keywords:	crystal glass desk large
Name:	a large crystal glass desk
RoomDesc:$
A large crystal glass desk, embedded with computer tech sits here.~
LookDesc:$
This desk is state of the art, but a little overboard for someone just
beginning in the world of high corporate power.  The technology inside this
desk, embedded in the heavy crystal glass is close to Fairlight Excalibur
level, and can probably support any persona programs you would want to place
inside of it.  From the looks of the tech, she's either very matrix-savvy, or
a big spender.
