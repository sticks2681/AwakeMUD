This is a large hewn stone tablet. The writing on it is in the ancient tongue
of Aramaic. You get the sense that the writing reads "You shall not make a

G-d, Who visits the sin of fathers on children to the third and fourth
generations, for My enemies; but Who shows kindness for thousands [of
generations] to those who love Me and observe My commandments"
