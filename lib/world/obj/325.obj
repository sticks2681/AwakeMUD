Name:	a worn-in black leather jacket
RoomDesc:$
A black leather jacket sits on the floor here, getting dirty.~
LookDesc:$
This jacket looks like someone has sewn on patches and then plucked out their
stitches later down the road, as its lined with two worn pinholes an equal
width apart from one another. Its a nice black colour, and its hard to tell if
its made from synthleather or actual leather, which is definately a plus if
you can get away with saying its real and nobodies the wiser.

Name:	A beat-up wooden club
RoomDesc:$
A beat-up wooden club has been left here.~
LookDesc:$
Its a simple piece of wood about three feet long, probably ripped off of a
shipping crate. It has a long, rusty and particularly nasty looking nail
sticking out of its business end. Good for smashing the heads of unsuspecting
chumps.
