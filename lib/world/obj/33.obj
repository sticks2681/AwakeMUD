A small steel key lies here discarded.~
LookDesc:$
It's a rather non-descript key, as plain and common as any other. It has an
older design to it, not only for that nostalgic appeal, but the fact that it
goes to an old fashioned lock to match.

A large table offers a place to sit here.~
LookDesc:$
This heavy picnic table is conveniently parked right in the shade so visitors
can kick up their feet on its spacious seats and take a load off. It is made
of some kind of macroplast compound, which was filled into a mold and cured to
create a single piece of furniture. The legs are bolted to the ground, just in
case someone tries to steal it, for whatever reason that may be.

nothing. They have small sticky pads, so when you slap it onto the wall
gravity will take hold and make it flop down, where it'll then stick and wait
to repeat the process, so as its namesake implies, it's a wall walker. Someone
is going to make a fortune off of these babies.. Definitely.

^gA large, ^ybrown^g grizzly bear mascot head is sitting here.^N~
LookDesc:$
This massive plushie head appears to have once been crafted in the image of a
grizzly bear, which was worn by the zoo employees during specials at the zoo
to help with revenue and entertain the kiddies. It hasn't been used in quite
some time, as the ragged and mangled ears on the bear head can attest to. It
certainly hasn't been cleaned in quite some time either, as bits and particles
of dust waft off of it when its moved. It features no mouth hole, and its eyes
are just little slits, allowing the wearer to see just a little bit of whats
infront of them, and that's about it. While it may have once been cute and
child friendly, its mangled and rather creepy appearance will probably only
frighten them and cause them to have nightmares for several weeks. Hence the
reason it's been stuffed into storage for so long.
