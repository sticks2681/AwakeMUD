^gA large ^Wwhite marble^g statue, hypnotic in its beauty, dominates the courtyard.^N~
LookDesc:$
Here stands a great marble effigy of Tyr, the god of Combat Prowess, Victory,
and the Sky. Chief of the Germanic pantheon of gods, Tyr sacrificed his right
hand to bind the Fenris Wolf's jaws with Gleipnir and all these details seem
to be mirrored in the creation of this marble masterpiece. His hair hangs to
his shoulders, and a short beard adorns a regal face with squared jaw and
fierce eyes that seem to retain a kind of fiery passion and liveliness through
the stone used to craft it. The stump of his right wrist is proudly displayed
and held at his side, refused to be hidden in shame. His left hand holds a
viking longsword, held upright with an orichalcum-accented ^YTiwaz rune^N at the
base of the blade, the symbol that represents the Sky God and his might.

Made from stunningly crafted crystal, almost all of its light reflecting

places more emphasis on design rather than on number of lights, and even with
only six candles, the fixture has so many angled and masterfully cut crystals
that the illumination from the candle lights easily reflects off of them to
brighten even the largest of rooms.

into clawed feet that, upon very close inspection, have Old Germanic runes
engraved upon their surface. The symbols represent prosperity, satisfaction,
and bounty, all of which are mirrored in the lavish elegance that this table
presents itself with. Covered in an elongated diamond cloth along most of its

hold a meal for two or three dozen people with plenty of room for unexpected

^gA massive ^Wwhite ash^g surrounded as its base by a magnificent stone statue.^N~
LookDesc:$
This Ash tree appears to be ancient and well cared for, its trunk rising
proudly toward the sky and the long branches stretching out across the
courtyard garden in a way that offers a large patch of shade for any who
may wish to contemplate beneath it. At its base, however, is the true
amazing piece of architecture, as the roots run over a carefully designed
stone planter and into soil though around it is entwined a creature that
is difficult to identify as anything known in the world, though to those
who know, its presence is unmistakable. On its folded wings the bodies of
men are evident, and its large, perhaps overexaggerated teeth are kept open
menacingly around one of the thick roots which bores into the earth, as if
ready to cleave through it at a moment's notice. Strewn about the base of
the structure are what appear to be innumerable corpses, lying prone in
various stages of decay and damage, from those who are in perfect condition,
to those who are missing great parts of their body and even skeletons creating
a suitable mound for the draconic being to rest upon. Though it is made of
marble, the faintest traces of metallic additions in the meticulously crafted
scales give the dragon an almost sparkling appearance kept faded by the shade
of the ash tree. This is Nidhogg, the Corpse Grinder, forever gnawing away at
the World Tree's roots to bring the link of all nine worlds crashing down when
Ragnarok comes. Though obviously spoken of as a dragon, it appears truly beastly
in appearance, with feathered wings peeking beneath the corpses grasping to it,
eyes that seem to shine maliciously despite the lack of ambient light glaring at
the focus of its eternal task, always glancing up at the great trunk of Yggdrasil.
A representation of the world in all its glory, and the impending doom that waits
to be unleashed at the twilight of the age.

The massive tapestry is crafted from the finest silks of varying shades of

depictions to stand out from the background beautifully. The story itself is
written in what looks to be an older dialect of sperethiel, but anyone with an
understanding of the language could most likely gleam the nature behind the
story, and its indications along with help from the detailed scenes. It starts
on the right hand side of the tapestry, and is read from top to bottom, left

group of elves. It is known as "The Perfidy of Dragons", and has seven
particular sections to its story. (Examine Section-One, Section-Two, et

Every elf-child knows that no good can come of dragons. We learned this lesson
from the dragon Alamaise, who cruelly took our good Queen Dallia from us. Now
Queen Dallia was wise and just, with a kind heart that made everyone love her.
And when the elves of Shosara strayed from elven ways, choosing foreign
customs over our own, Queen Dallia showed them great mercy. She did not punish
them in anger, though they richly deserved chastisement. Instead, she chose to
travel from Wyrm Wood to see and judge Shosara with her own eyes before
pronouncing their fate upon them. Alas for Wyrm Wood and for all elvenkind,
that Queen Dallia's kindness should doom her in their place.

With her trustiest warriors at her side, Queen Dallia went forth. She had
scarcely been two days on the road when suddenly the skies turned black and a
fierce wind blew, as if a great storm was coming. Queen Dallia looked up, and
saw that the darkness was no storm cloud. It was the vast shape of a dragon,
hovering in front of the sun and making a cold wind with the beating of his
mighty wings.

Queen Dallia bowed politely to the dragon and wished him good day. But the
dragon showed no such courtesy. "I am Alamaise," he said, without so much as a
word of greeting. "I am lord over Wyrm Wood, the forest Named for my kind
since the world was made. I have come to claim your allegiance." Queen Dallia
was greatly surprised by this, but answered graciously nonetheless. "I am
Queen Dallia, sovereign of Wyrm Wood," she said. "Your words are strange to
me, but I will gladly honor you if you can show me just cause."

Alamaise spread his wings wide, puffing himself up with arrogance. "You and
your people are mine," he said. "You and your Wood belong to me. I gave you
life." - "With Respect," Queen Dallia said, hiding her growing annoyance, "I
think you are mistaken. The Passions Jaspree and Astendar gave us life, so
that the tree Oak Heart would have fit companions. And Jaspree made Oak Heart,
from which the Wood grew. How then are you our maker?" Alamaise puffed himself
up even further. "I persuaded Jaspree to plant the seed that became Oak
Heart," he said. "And I told the Passions to make the elves. Without me, you
would not exist. And so you must bow down to me-- you and all your kind."

The dragon's words angered Queen Dallia, for she heard the lie in them. "My
people bow to no one, save the Passions that created us and the Universe
itself that made all life. We elves are a free people, and belong to no one
but ourselves. You cannot have our allegiance, or even our respect, simply by
demanding it-- you must deserve it. And from your ill manners and the
falsehoods you have told, you deserve nothing but our scorn." Our queen's
pride and beauty angered the dragon in turn. He flapped his wings and made a
furious wind. "You dare defy me?!" he roared, in a voice as loud as ten
thunderstorms. But Queen Dallia was not afraid. "I do," she answered him. "And
so do all my people."

The dragon roared again, shaking the earth so hard that Queen Dallia and her
warriors fell to the ground. Then he blew a mighty flame from his giant mouth,
and burned our queen to cinders. He blew again, slaying half the warriors even
as they struggled to nock arrows to their bows. Then, as he drew a breath to
blow a third time, the sky opened and a shining light poured out. The light
enveloped Alamaise, holding him motionless. From its bright heart stepped
Jaspree and Astendar, their faces dark with sorrow and anger. They advanced
upon the dragon and cursed him for the evil he had done to their children.
Because he had taken life unjustly, all his works would turn to barrenness;
because he had slain beauty, he would no longer know loveliness in any sight
or sound. Then they took up the elves, both the living and the dead, and bore
them on a river of light back to Wyrm Wood.

especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the
eternal return, and other things perceived as cycles that begin anew as soon
as they end, much akin to the symbolism of the Phoenix. It can also represent
the idea of primordial unity related to something existing in or persisting

Name:	an ancient clockwork puzzlebox
RoomDesc:$
A weird looking clockwork puzzlebox has been left here, waiting to be solved.~
LookDesc:$
At first glance this puzzlebox looks new and modernly constructed, but it
isn't until one holds it in their hand that they can tell the depths of its
age, and the multitude of hands it has passed down through. This clockwork
puzzlebox is a work of art surpassed by very few others, namely due to its
intricate and finely detailed clockwork gears and pins, allowing it to be
twisted, turned and slide its sections to solve its answer. The surfaces are
designed immaculately to represent literally dozens of alternate symbols and
letters, most of which aren't even within the same language. As to what it
holds, no one can tell. Perhaps some things are best left unknown.

This lariat is made from stiff, wire reinforced rope so that the noose stays
open when the lasso is thrown. It also allows the cowboy to easily open up the
noose from horseback to release the cattle because the rope is stiff enough to
be pushed a little. This high quality lasso is weighted for better handling,
and it has a small reinforced loop at one end, called a honda, through which
the rope passes to form a loop. The honda can be formed by a honda knot (or
another loop knot), an eye splice, a seizing, or a metal ring. The other end
is tied simply in a small, tight, overhand knot to prevent fraying.

^gA pair of ^Lblack leather^N tanker boots with ^Worichalcum spurs^g have been left sitting here.^N~
LookDesc:$
These ^Lblack leather^N tanker boots are military boots closely associated with
soldiers who serve on tanks and tracked vehicles in general. Whereas regular
combat boots are laced through metal eyelets along their leather upper, the
tanker boots are fastened with leather straps which wrap around the upper
ankle and buckle near the top. This benefits the wearer in several ways, as
the problem with laces is that they can become undone easily and then
entangled in the many exposed, moving parts of a tank, they also allow for
improved circulation to the feet, and the design of their sewn-in tongue makes
them waterproof. These boots are equipped with dentiplast toe-guards, as well
as shank/heel guards, as befitting a boot intended for a hazardous operating
environment. An accessory has been added by their owner, which comes in the
form of ornately designed eight-pointed rowel riding spurs crafted from
^Worichalcum^N.

fully adjustable straps can be fitted and worn in comfort while causing as

been modified, and most of its guts have been updated with newer materials, as
well has having its firing pin swapped out and its springs replaced to deal
with the added stress of firing hotter and more powerful loads, as well as
having its magazine extended to handle its eighteen rounds of 10mm ammunition. It
has a polished ^Wchrome^N-^Wplated^N finish, which has been beautifully detailed with

LookDesc:$
The flammenschwert, German for "Flame Blade", has a characteristically
undulating style of blade, the wave pattern is often considered to contribute
a flame-like quality to the appearance of the sword. While largely decorative,
some attributes of the waved blade were useful in combat, including an
increased cutting surface and slightly reduced weight. When parried or blocked
by another blade in combat, the design of the blade causes unpleasant
vibrations to be transmitted into the others blade, slowing their contact with
additional friction as it encounters each successive wave. The edge seems to
sport a monofilament treatment, and its blade and grip are quite long,
allowing it to be wielded with equal ease in a single hand or both hands. A
highly ornate pommel encases a carved ^Lzircon orb^N the size of a quarter to help
perfectly balance the sword, as do its decorative parrying hooks and long
^Worichalcum^N inlaid ricasso.

The Walker Colt was the largest and most powerful black powder repeating
handgun ever made, but it seems this particular gun has been modified and
upgraded to fire an up to date cartridge. It was created in the mid-1840s in a
collaboration between Captain Samuel Hamilton Walker and American firearms
inventor Samuel Colt, building upon the earlier Colt Paterson design. Walker
wanted a handgun that was extremely powerful at close range, and he got it
with this single action revolver with a revolving cylinder holding six rounds
chambered for .454 magnum cartridges, which were originally .44 ball rounds
before it was modified and updated. The entire peice is covered with
^Worichalcum^N inlays and etchings, and while its beautiful original walnut grip
isn't in the best of condition, it only adds to its larger than life
personality.

scales inset with ^bazure^N gemstone scales that shimmer and sparkle as light
washes over it, their eyes set with small ^Lblack diamond^N pupils. The shaft is
crafted from solid oak and covered in lacquered bamboo strips in a polygonal
cross section, which are in turn wrapped in etched metal rings. A highly
decorative ^Wivory^N pommel is affixed to the bottom to offer an impeccable degree
of balance to the lengthy weapon, making it equally impressive hanging above a

An antique WWII pistol sits on display here.~
LookDesc:$
The Mauser C96, with its shoulder stock, long barrel and high-velocity
cartridge, had superior range and better penetration than most other standard
pistols, as the 7.63x25mm Mauser cartridge was the highest velocity
commercially manufactured pistol cartridge in existence until the advent of
the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935. The wooden shoulder stock can double as a
holster or carrying case, and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom, whose
distinctive appearance earned the gun the nickname "Broomhandle" in the
English-speaking world. The C-96 is a recoil operated, locked breech,
semi-automatic pistol. It utilizes a short recoiling barrel with its bolt
located inside the large barrel extension. The bolt and barrel are locked by
the vertically tilting locking piece with two lugs, which lock into the
recesses on the bottom of the bolt itself. It features a select fire switch,
allowing it to fire in either semi-automatic or three round bursts.

rifles and light machine guns used by the U.S. and numerous other countries
during the 20th century. The primary variant of the BAR series was the M1918,
this particular model, which is chambered for the .30-06 Springfield rifle
cartridge and was designed by legendary firearms inventor John Browning in
1917 for the U.S. Expeditionary Corps in Europe as a replacement for the
French-made Chauchat and M1909 Benet-Mercie machine guns. The BAR was designed
to be carried by advancing infantrymen, slung over the shoulder and fired from
the hip, a concept known as "walking fire", thought to be necessary for the
individual soldier during trench warfare. The M1918 is a selective fire,
air-cooled automatic rifle that uses a gas-operated long stroke piston rod
actuated by propellant gases bled through a vent in the barrel, which allows
it to put down rapid bursts of walking fire for advancing infantry.

The Maschinengewehr Model 42, better known as a the MG 42, is a 7.92x57mm
machine gun that was developed in Nazi Germany and entered service with the
Wehrmacht in 1942. This firearm has a proven record of reliability,
durability, simplicity, and ease of operation, but is most notable for being
able to produce a stunning volume of suppressive fire. The MG 42 has one of
the highest average rates of fire of any single-barreled man-portable machine
gun, between 1,200 and 1,500 rounds per minute, resulting in a distinctive
muzzle report. At such a high rate the human ear cannot easily discern the
sound of individual bullets being fired, and in use the gun makes a sound
likened to "ripping cloth", which gave rise to its nickname, "Hitler's
Buzzsaw". So distinct and terrifying was the weapon that the United States
Army created training films to aid its soldiers in dealing with the
psychological trauma of facing the weapon in battle, and even in this day and
age, it has lost none of its lethality.

The M2, otherwise known as the Browning .50 Caliber, is a heavy machine gun
that was designed towards the end of World War I by legendary firearms
inventor John Browning. It is very similar in design to John Browning's
earlier M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the .30-06
cartridge. The M2 uses the larger and more powerful .50 BMG cartridge, which
was named for the gun itself (BMG standing for Browning Machine Gun). The M2
has earned many nicknames in its lengthy time in service, such as the "Ma
Deuce", or "The Fifty" in reference to its caliber. Even today it remains an
effective weapon against infantry, unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and
boats, light fortifications, and low-flying aircraft. This particular variant
features a water jacket, which pumps cold water around the barrel to keep it
from overheating, which it is apt to do with the high rate of fire it's
capable of, allowing it to be fired for extended periods without warping the
barrel.

This golden cherry-like fruit is sweet and can produce mild euphoria. In place
of a cherry's pit, the fleshy red center is filled with small dark seeds. When
powdered and added to food or drink (wine made from laesal fruit is especially
effective), those who ingest the substance is can suffer from a period of
unconciousness and cause a chemical inbalance in portions of the brain dealing
with short term memory, often resulting in the complete short-term memory
loss.

An executioner's sword of transcendental beauty hangs proudly on display here.~
LookDesc:$
This ornately adorned executioner's sword is of a German design that dates
back to the early 15th century, which, as its name would suggest, was used in
the execution of those found guilty by decapitation. Unlike most swords, it's
wide blade is constructed in a perfectly straight manner from one end of the
blade to its tip, which does not taper off to a point, and instead has a
sharpened boxed edge. A beautifully stylized engraving travels a quarter of
the way up the bottom of the blades wide fuller, which reads in German:
"Werfen Sie im Namen des Gottes - Sie Schuldig". Various other Germanic runes
decorate its length, obviously for ceremonial and decorative purposes, and
while its edge is honed to a fine razor sharp quality, it features nicks and
other blemishes, indicating where it was damaged while being used to
decapitate its victims. It features no hilt, as it was not designed for the
purpose of combat, and its handle and pommel are both equally adorned in
lavish engravings for ritual purpose.
