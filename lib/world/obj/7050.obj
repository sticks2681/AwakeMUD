LookDesc:$
This massive black monolith seems to almost be alive. It is a Steinway & Sons
Model D Concert Grand Piano, they do not make piano's any better than this
one. Made by hand it takes a boggling 1 year to build and assemble. People
place orders for these years in advance. Made of real maple, oak, spruce,
ebony, and ivory this piano is a treasure of rarity and almost priceless. The
melodies arising from it as Sam strokes the keys fill the room with a soft
glow of peace and hope. Underneath the piano is a small box.

This pool looks very old. Made of marble, granite, and plaster, it looks like
something out of the time of Rome. Whomever built it knew what it meant to
really bathe. Seats are set underwater here and there while giving plenty of
room to still swim and float without invading anyone else's space. A smaller
pool is walled off near the back, being fed the warmer water coming from the
deep heated springs beneath this cavern.

Sturmabteilung translates to Storm Division, or more commonly, Stormtroopers.
This dagger belonged to an officer of the SA Standarte Felderrnhalle, an elite
unit of the Sturmabteilung charged with protecting the rulers of Nazi Germany.
The pommel is made of Ivory and based on an eagle with wings spread open, its
talons clutching a Swastika the emblem of the 3rd Reich. It is 45 cm long and
etched into the blade with precision is the motto "Alles fur Deutschland"
(Everything for Germany). Reputedly there are less than 50 of these daggers
that were made, making it one of the rarest and most valuable daggers of the
3rd Reich.
