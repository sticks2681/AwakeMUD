This unique revolver was developed way back in 1856 by a certain Pierre LeMat,
which comprises a nine shot .44 Caliber model pistol. The major difference
from this gun and its modern counterparts is it also contains a 5cm-shotgun
barrel, allowing it fire off its eight pistol rounds, and when that fails to
finish off the target, one last nasty surprise can be fired from its single
load short barreled shotgun feature. Sure to please the most discriminating
gun enthusiast that you know.

of customers, on the other hand, the name chosen name Assassin was a rather
clumsy marketing tactic with negative consequences. The Enforcer is now based
on the Urban Combat, which applies its integral suppressor and venting system
