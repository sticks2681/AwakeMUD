A strange-looking hunk of oddly glowing metal is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
It appears to be a part of something, but you can not tell what.  The metal
glows oddly, sort of an ethereal purple.  Some strange markings are on it -
maybe some language.  It appears to have fasteners on each end of it to place
it into whatever it belongs to.
