Headlines: Hollywood rejects trying to make a name.
 Recently, a new group of losers have moved into the Sprawl.  These guys are
rejects from old tridvids.  Seven trolls, calling themselves the Magnificent
Seven have attempted to gain ground in South Seattle. Their first attempted at
showing force failed miserably as a single Runner mowed them down without
breaking a sweat. One escaped, unfortunately.
 This reporter has uncovered evidence that these trolls, aren't really trolls,
but genetically mutated humans.  It is no wonder a real troll pasted them all
over the ground. Don't be overjoyed yet.  This is just the first attempt at
mutating.  What happens when the drek who started this, mutates trolls into
something worse.

Headlines: Rogue decker disabled Panicbutton.
 In a malicious attempt to harm others, a rogue decker disabled the
Panicbutton system Tuesday. Flooding the central desk with billions of false
reports, the Panicbutton system had to be shutdown, and its comm grid
rerouted. Federal and local officials have formed a joint task force to track
this cyber bandit.
 Truth be known, Marilyn Schultz, governor of Seattle has publically stated on
numerous occasions her dislike for the Matrix and those who operate in it.
This reporter believes this is a government attempt to eliminate honest
deckers.  Be warned Runners of the Net, this lady is fanatical.  Already,
known surfers such as, CrackerX, Synsix, and G33Kster have been classified
missing on all available datanets.  Anyone who knows these guys, understands,
they always leave a mark.  This time, nothing....
