RoomDesc:$
A strip of dried beef sits here, just waiting to be eaten.~
LookDesc:$
Biltong is a kind of cured meat that originated in South Africa. Many
different types of meat can be used to make it, ranging from beef to various
game meats, even to fillets of ostrich. This one happens to be made from raw
fillets of beef cut into strips following the grain of the muscle. It is
similar to beef jerky in that they are both spiced, dried meats, but differ in
their typical ingredients, taste and production process. The word biltong is
from the Dutch word bil ("rump") and tong ("strip" or "tongue").

Crayfish, 'crawfish', or 'crawdads' are freshwater crustaceans that resemble
small lobsters, to which they are closely related. They have been shiskabobbed
on carved wooden skewers, doused with a mixture of spices and herbs, and slow
roasted over an open flame. They are cooked to perfection and are quite
delicious, try some.

LookDesc:$
Asi, or 'Black Drink' is a beverage brewed by the Native Americans of the
Southeastern United States. It was prepared from the roasted leaves and stems
of the Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria), which is native to the Atlantic and Gulf
Coasts. The active ingredient in the drink is caffeine. Creeks, Cherokees,
Choctaws, and others believed it purified the drinker and purged him of anger
and falsehoods. The Black drink is prepared by Speaks-with-Many personally,
and is served in a large whelkshell cup. Originally it was consumed by men in
the tribal council, who were served in order of precedence, starting with
important visitors. They would consume large quantities at a sitting, and
afterwards, purge themselves by vomiting.

stronger than paint thinner, and you swear it just singed your nose hairs from
a simple wiff. Its unclear what proof the liquid is, but its safe to say its
high enough to make you murder your children, eat half your livestock, beat
your wife, and keep you in a coma for the next week and a half. Enjoy.

Shedeh is a drink that was prized in ancient Egypt, and this particular type

fairly well with the natural sweetness of the fruit, it has somewhat of an

hand-made ^cdark blue ceramic^N dish, which has been polished to a gleam, its
raised lip helping to keep its contents within when one wanders around with it

Kykeon (Greek for "to stir, to mix") is an ancient Greek drink comprised
mainly of water, barley and herbs. It was used at the climax of the Eleusinian
Mysteries to break a sacred fast, but it was also a favourite drink of Greek
peasants. It is supposed to have digestive properties, but Kykeon is more
infamously known for being processed with barley parasitized by ergot, which
is a fungus that once consumed has various psychoactive properties, and has
been known to trigger intense experiences. Fortunately, this is a mild
mixture, so the drinker should only have the slightest affects... or atleast
thats what the tender implied. Won't know until you try it. It is served in a
dull, hand-hammered ^ybronze^N cup.

(Oba) wisely restraining his limitless powers. Only the Oba and his hunters
were entitled to kill leopards and then, only for sacrificial purposes.

RoomDesc:$
A lowball glass sits here, full of some kind of liquor.~
LookDesc:$
Applejack is an alcoholic drink made from apples, which traces its origins
back to the American colonies. It is made by concentrating hard cider via
evaporative distillation. It smells and tastes heavily of apples, and has
quite a kick to it. Its served in a lowball glass, which contains more than
enough of the liquid the consumer to feel its effects.

RoomDesc:$
A small wax-paper bag of peanuts sits here.~
LookDesc:$
These peanuts have been glazed in egg whites and covered lightly in a mixture
of paprika, salt, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, black, white
and red peppers. They are then baked until the peanuts are toasted and
completely dry. They come in a small wax-paper pouch, and seem to be perfect
for working off the affects of a night of heavy drinking.

Name:	a small, lumpy manila envelope
RoomDesc:$
A small manila envelope sits on the floor here, looking suspicious.~
LookDesc:$
This small manila envelope looks like any other office supply, although it
does seem to have a cylindrical lump inside of it, since apparently something
has been stuffed into it. The seal is a little rough, and there looks to be a
few stains on the paper towards one end of whatever is inside, which has a
dark orange/brown colour to it. If one feels and squeezes it, it seems to
roughly be the size of a finger.... but maybe thats just a coincidence?
