LookDesc:$
This ancient looking manuscript appears to have been written here. A small,
silver chain attached to the leather binding, prevents anyone from taking it.
The pages are dried, cracked, and yellow with age. The words, or runes, seem
to pulse with mystic energy.  The knowledge they impart, is often sought after
by magical scholars. The book is open to the Index and there are many pages to
be read.

A final note: Traveling into the metaplanes is an arduous endeavor.  Many
highly skilled magicians have perished before completing their quest. Caution,
patience and perserverance are traits common of those who have successfully
walked the astral realm.

the Shadows(tm)>

Each metaplane has many Places known to humanity, which correspond to human
experiences. A Place can be an abstract "landscape" of magical energy or seem
as real and solid as the material world.  It can be populated by creatures out
of nightmares, empty of all life, or filled with beings going about their own
concerns.  It may appear as any scene from history, fantasy, or myth.
 A traveler may find their appearence altered as they move from place to
place. There are some Places that even the most knowledgable of travelers
cannot comprehend. Once a magician enters the metaplanes, they are unable to
leave until they have completed a specific task or quest.

An aura is an energy field within the etheric body.  The aura's of living and
non-living beings and objects vary. Living beings are classified as having
active aura's, while, non-living objects have passive aura's.  A trained
magician can assense the difference with amazing accuracy.
 Assensing an aura can give a magician quite a bit of information on the
subject. One can determine the relative level of essence on the subject.
Whether the subject is magically active, or enchanted.  Whether or not, the
subject is the under a spell, or possessed by a spirit. The true form of the
subject.  Etheric forms cannot be altered or disguised by transformation
spells. Magicians are also able to determine why background residue is
present.

Information on the etheric plane is a matter of moods, emotions, textures, and
tones. In the material realm, only data is present, emotional tone must be
deduced from the content.  In the etheric plane, the words would appear as
random, illegible marks on paper. In the etheric plane, the reader is able to
assense anger, hurt, or the emotional feelings of the writer.
 Background energy refers to the presence of powerful influences that can
distort the etheric medium.  Certain influences have been known to be
beneficial to travelers. More times than not, background energy can be
hazardous.  The longer one remains in these areas, the worse the hazard
becomes.  Some instances have been recorded, where the hazards were permanent.
 Background energy is not constant, magical impulses flow and ebb in
irregular rhythms. Theorists have classified background residue into five
levels, the fifth level being the most deadly.

Man-made objects are visible on the etheric plane, but not solid. An astral
traveler cannot see through them, but may pass, or reach, through them, unless
tied to the physical world, as with dual natured beings.
 An object's etheric form is usually a duplicate of its physical form. Magical
enchantments or influences can be detected on its etheric form.  Similarly,
places that have been the site of extremely powerful magic or events with
powerful emotional charges will retain traces of that information in their
etheric form.
 The traces of a minor spell, or a single act of violence, love, or worship,
last only a few hours.  The more potent the event, the longer and more durable
the trace left is.
 Acts involving extreme violence or emotion may leave a background residue
which, can overwhelm astral senses.

Various paraspecies have a "dual nature".  Dual beings are always active on
both the astral and physical planes, like a magician using perception. Dual
beings exist naturally on both planes at once. Their presence is generally
limited to the etheric plane, however, some dual natured beings have been
known to travel the metaplanes.
 Special powers of certain dual beings, such as the deadly gaze of a basilisk,
or the flaming breath of dragons, are created by the interaction of their twin
natures. Astral energy is brought into the physical realm through their
bodies.  These powers do not work in astral space. Although, a dragon's astral
teeth will still shred someone like fettuccine in one bite.

As far as anyone knows, astral beings are all spirits of some kind. They may
sometimes manifest on the physical plane, they are native to astral space.
 Most spirits have an affinity to, at least one, metaplane, or their native
plane. For example, a fire elemental is native to the hermetic metaplane of
fire, a city spirit to the shamanic metaplane of man.  Spirits can travel, at
will, to their native plane.
 Nature Spirits and elementals can appear in one of three forms: astral form,
manifest form, and great form. Only through careful plannig should a magician
call for a great form spirit.

Just what is an astral body?
 Everything has one, to some extent.  Some entities, such as people, can
seperate their physical and astral bodies.  Others, like spirits, have nothing
but an astral body, though they are able to, at times, manifest temporarily in
to a physical form. Most things, living or non, have at least an etheric body,
or astral presence in the etheric plane.  The more alive a body is, the more
solid its etheric body will be.
 Astral bodies cannot affect the physical realm, or in any way influence the
physical world.

	Desc:$
Magicians have always believed that astral space is divided into many
different planes The basic description of astral space refers to the etheric
plane.  This basic level of astral space corresponds to the physical universe,
and serves as the medium for magical energy that affects the physical world.
The etheric is not the only plane in astral space.
 Each of the hermetic elements has its own plane, as does each shamanic power.
Each plane exists in a different "dimension" in the astral universe.
 Access to these planes cannot be attained by any magician.  One must be able
to astrally project to these planes. Only the few, who have undergone some
sort of initiation, may attempt travel into the metaplanes.
 Everything that exists in the material, or physical realm, is visible in the
etheric plane.  Even items that are not tangible.  Simply put, everything has
some sort of astral body.

Images twist and form, showing you the history of the world.  Mother Earth
quakes in the visions.  Her body bleeds molten lava, her face cries with ice,
snow, and rain, her limbs extend to the heavens.
 Large reptilian creatures roam across her.  They feed on her gifts, they
fight, eat, and breed with each other.
 Man appears and hunts the beasts.  Man appears and changes the face of Earth.
Man appears and breaks the planet.
 Violent images of war stream past.  Millions of souls cry out, as their last
breath leaves them. The earth shakes with the turmoil.  Huge explosions rack
the face of the earth.  Large storms try to repair the damage.

cities. Huge metal buildings rise skyward.  Armed men roam the streets.  War
continues across the earth. Resources dwindled.  Men in business flaunted
power with force. A viral plague sends images of hundreds of thousands dying
horribly.
 Strange mutations cause children to be born "different". The Awakening
brought mythical beasts across the planet.  Dragons and serpents appeared. The
first signs of magic, the Great Ghost Dance cause Mother Earth to weep again.
With her tears come eruptions, killing millions. Millions more metamorph into
hideous humanoids.
 Another world is formed.  Electrical pulses fuse and bind to form a realm of
technology and electronics.  Virtual existance through electricity.
 Violence rages on still.  Wars are smaller, but no less devastating.  Small
groups of men strike fear into larger groups.  Terrorism reigns. Magical power
becomes abused.  Spikes of emotion, violence, and magic leave permanent
impression of the Earth's face.
