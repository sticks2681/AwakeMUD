RoomDesc:$
A small handheld scanning device lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This handheld device features a small monitor, several blinking lights and a
rectangular control panel. It scans various frequencies, but primarily detects
locally-generated signals by their strengths, and will not detect bugs unless
they are transmitting. Bug scanners typically take up to 30 minutes to find a
transmission, and can be left in "passive alarm" mode, during which they flash
a light when a transmission is detected. This particular bug scanner has a
small label on it that reads, "Rating 4."

RoomDesc:$
An optical chip lies here.~
LookDesc:$
A label on this tiny (2 cm. by 3 cm. by 1 cm.) chip identifies it as a
"Skilltwitcher." Similar to standard skillsofts, skilltwitchers send a jamming
signal into skillwire implants, making them far more difficult to use.
Skilltwitchers are frequently combined with jackstoppers to make their removal
difficult.

RoomDesc:$
An electronic keycard attached to a small box lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This device is designed to fool a maglock with a passcard system into opening.
The passkey is slotted through the cardreader in the same way as any
legitimate passcard is, and the device attempts to electronically force the
lock. Using maglock passkeys often leaves a lock scrambled or sluggish to
respond, providing indications that the lock's been violated. This particular
passkey bears a sticker on its bottom that reads, "Rating 5."
