                                Seattle State Park
Seattle State Park was designed by the architect Edward Hjieln, sometimes
called the symmetrical freak of the 21st century.  He began his work in the
early 2020's, and construction began in 2031.

At a glance, this appears to be the typical keycard to an electronic keycard.
However, closer inspection reveals that it's actually embossed with a winding,
Japanese dragon, gilded in a shinier gloss than its matte background. A thin
silver line runs across the edge, reflecting almost like a hologram.
