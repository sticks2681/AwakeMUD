armor that BioHyde scientists have spent years to perfect. Although they still
have the customary preliminary glitches, their efficiency is without equal at
this point in time. Their hyper-polymated stitching consists of a toughened
psychoplasmic substance that feeds on the adrenaline pumped out through the
wearer's veins, and a targetting mechanism buried deep in the wearer's skin
once worn to enhance accuracy in combat.
