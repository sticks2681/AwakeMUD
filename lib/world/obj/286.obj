Name:	an Ares .357 Swamp Fox heavy revolver
RoomDesc:$
A heavy revolver is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
This is the famed Ares 'Swamp Fox' .357 Magnum single-action revolver.  When
used, it has been known to shoot through thick wooden doors and lesser metal
ones, often destroying their targets on the other side. Very little upkeep is
needed for this firearm to function properly, its inner mechanisms nearly
immune to all climate and enviromental abuse. This pistol can only take
special Ares .357 magnum rounds due its casing size, and although it is an
outdated single-action revolver type design, it has an almost cult-like
following because of its reliability in the field, not to mention its as
intimidating as it is deadly. Many a Knight-Errant subsidiary sings the high
praise that is the Swamp Fox, its even rumored that Lone Star is practically
begging to outfit their beat cops with them, but fortunately for shadowrunners
it hasn't proven cost effective.
