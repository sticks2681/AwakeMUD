With a deep, voluminous hood, this floor-length cloak is made from the same
materials as fire-resistant and non-conductive materials as the Majesty and
offers the same advantages. The Merlin lacks the flair of the Majesty,
however, and instead incorporates subtle "mystical" emblems and patterns, many
of which are commonly employed by British druids.

Keywords:	rapier blade sword coal silver coalsilver long thin steel blackish
Name:	a coal-meshed silver rapier
RoomDesc:$
A long, thin blade of blackish silver is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
The blade is almost 1 and a half meters long, and expertly constructed out of
materials you have never laid eyes on before. The hilt is made of sandy
marbled ivory, the handle sculpted in the figure of two tails twisting
downwards towards a dragon's head at the bottom, where two cut rubies are set
in the eyesockets. From the hilt, a sheen blade of rare coal-meshed silver
rises for nearly two meters. Double edged, the blade is almost too big for any
normal person. Intricately carved ancient symbols ride up the inside of the
blade, dancing off of highlighted spots of dikote-strengthened silver, up into
a point at the end that is almost too fine to see with the naked eye.
