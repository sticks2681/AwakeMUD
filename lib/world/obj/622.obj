original design created by Gordon B. Ingram. Like its predecessor the MAC-20
fires from an open bolt, the light weight of which results in a rapid rate of
fire, and its barrel is threaded to accept a suppressor.

as it can be used to seperate the strands of heavy rope lines and mending
sails, it also serves as an impromptu dagger, making it just as useful in the

The colichemarde sword evolved from the rapier due to the demand for a lighter
sword better suited to parrying, its design consisting of a wide forte with
several fullers, which tapers drastically toward a point after the fullers
end. Its lighter weight and superior balance compared to the rapier allowed
faster and more accurate movement of the blade, allowing a fencer to place
more precise thrusts upon their adversary.

Based on the original Thompson design, this updated version brought to the

drum-fed design offers it plenty of lead to spray around at anyone stupid
enough to get infront of it. Since it has proven to be quite a challenge to
keep on target the barrel has been fitted with an improved gas vent IV system,
and due to its design it cannot mount underbarrel accessories.

serious drawbacks for that, as it is also somewhat heavier than traditional
revolvers of similar caliber and barrel length.
