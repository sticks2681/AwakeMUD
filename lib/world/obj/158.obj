RoomDesc:$
A bundle of rags and leaves lies here.~
LookDesc:$
This SOTA Ghillie suit is substantially more comfortable and much more
effective than a traditional Ghillie suit. The UCAS and CAS armed forces have
rigorously field tested them and found the Spectrum Ghillie suit equaled or
surpassed traditional ghillies in every category. The synthetic fabric is
extremely strong, durable, and sound absorbent. Sewn onto the suits frame are
hundreds of small leaves made of ruthenium fabric. This system allows the suit
to individually place preloaded images onto each ruthenium leaf. A
mini-computer attached to the wearers wrist can store dozens of images such as
grass, leaves, wheat, pine needles, the bark of various trees, camouflage
patterns ranging from urban camo to jungle tiger pattern, and the full
spectrum of matte colors. While not able to give a user true invisibility this
suit assists the wearer immensely in stalking and any situation requiring
stealth and high concealment on the modern battlefield.

This adult common raven is actually a northwestern crow, its smaller, square
tail is a tell tale sign to a trained eye. Its plumage is a glossy black
color, while its cold beady eyes are a darker shade, which tend to stare at

of its tail, but makes up for its physical stature in an audible manner,
occasionally offering one of its deep patented croaks or a hoarse "rrronk."

Oh shit! The Fuzz! Cheese it! That was the immediate response these shades
usually had on the public. These aviator styled shades were made popular to
the public by law enforcement and harken back to not-so-fond memories for
most. The reason why they were so popular is easy to see, not only did their
large, slightly curved design offer a broader range of protection from glare
and brighter lighting situations, but they also restricted ones peripheral
vision less than the majority of most other types of glasses. Despite their
namesake, these glasses were not originally intended for pilots, but rather,
their design was intended for shooting.

osmosis and expelled from the system at the back of the neck. However, because
they extract pure oxygen, they can be used only at depths less than 7 meters.
Divers using them at deeper depths risk oxygen toxicity.

obviously differs from one part to the next. It runs with the DH-42XVA custom
operating system, which is capable of uploading and downloading up to two
million gigapulses per milisecond, and is the only machine capable of running
the millions of simultaneous equations that keep its large sculpted host
active. It is heavily armoured to prevent physical damage, and the massive
racks of intercoolers and liquid nitrogen tanks attached to it protect it from
heat damage. A massive red handle is embedded inti its side, marked "EMERGENCY
SHUTDOWN", and is secure in place via a high-end maglock bolt.

A pair of slick looking shades lies on the floor.~

These sleek, sporty wrap-around style shades were very popular in the late
20th century, and even today enjoy some marginal success with the younger
crowd. The dark, almost jet black tint the lenses offered were perfect for
those cool types who just had to wear all black, and they went wonderfully
with leather outfits as well, perfect for that poser in you! Oakley(TM) has
certainly outdone themselves this time around, giving the frontrunner consumer
exactly what they wanted. Their signature 'O' emblem is stamped onto the
sides, just so everyone knew what you were wearing.

The gangster hat, more commonly called a fedora hat, first appeared around

men's hats, with gangster hats being the most popular during the swing era and
the days of the Chicago mobs. The gangster fedora hat has been associated with
characters on both sides of the law, they have been seen on everyone from Al
Capone to Elliot Ness, and Frank Sinatra. This gangster hat has a 2 3/8" brim
and is made of crushable black wool felt (so it keep its great shape). Because
it's soft, it is an easy hat to personalize by breaking down the brim in the
front, back and sides, or pinching the crown in varying degrees. You can flip
it all kinds of ways, put it on and shape it the way you want it. It's like
wearing a new hat everyday.

Commandment #9: You Word Is Your Bond - The whole point of these rules is to build some kind of trust between runners and Johnsons. Laugh all you want, but that's the deal. Shadowrunners and those who hire them have to be able to trust each other, if only a little, or the whole system falls apart. A Johnson who gets a reputation for fragging over runners and hiring for suicide missions won't be able to hire very many runners after a while. A runner who gets a rep for burning employers and flapping his lips
 about every run will end up unemployable (or floating face down in the nearest body of water). This is where the quality they used to call honor comes in. If you tell a Johnson you're going to do something, do it. If a Johnson betrays you, make sure everyone knows it. Remember, the shadows work both ways. The corps need us like we need them; they don't want a rogue Johnson making them target number one (or worse, blacklisted by the quality talent). The pressure is on a corp with a rogue Johnson is immense
-- and if you get the plum job of hunting the bastich down, think of where you stand with the corp and the shadow community.

Commandment #8: Maintain Silence - This rule is related to not fragging over your employer. Once you've finished a run, keep your mouth shut about it. The corp is paying for your silence along with your expertise. That means don't go blabbing at the local watering hole about the latest run you pulled off, don't post the gory details all over the Matrix and don't go telling your friends how you helped pull off the run of the century. If you just have to talk about a run on a secure node like Shadowland, at 
least change the names and dates to protect your employer's interests. If word leaks about a run, Mr. Johnson will come looking for you first. And if you think that having this information gives you something to hold over Mr. Johnson's head, think again. It just makes you worth more to him dead than alive. On the other hand, share as much as you can with your runner chummers. I know that sounds like a contradiction, but if you tell us about the bleeding-edge security measures at a Novatech site you just hi
t, we don't care who hired you or why-- we just need to know the stuff that may impact us.

Commandment #7: Don't Frag Over Your Employer - Pay attention; the next
sentence is the most important one you'll ever read. DO NOT FRAG OVER YOUR
EMPLOYER. A shadowrunner who gets caught double-dealing or trying to betray an
employer is almost certainly a dead shadowrunner. Even if you manage to
survive scamming your Johnson, you can pretty much forget about ever working
the shadows again. (You can always change your name and face, or go somewhere
they've never heard of you, but it better be somewhere your Johnson and his
corporation can't find you.) Corporations rely on shadowrunners, but they
can't afford to let runners think they can pull drek and get away with it.
Shadowrunners who turn against their employers are usually made an example for
the rest of us. I've seen a few in my time, and I learned my lesson well.
Don't frag with Mr. Johnson-- It's just not worth it.

Commandment #6: Limit Collateral Damage - The corps expect a certain number of
shadowruns to happen; that's the price of doing business. However, the more
damage you do, the more you cost the corp. The more you cost it, the more
likely the corp is to come down hard on you. In other words, never make it
more worthwhile for the corp to geek you than to leave you alone. Collateral
damage means wrecking anything you don't absolutely need to in order to get at
your target; killing or wounding corporate personnel, destroying corporate
property, trashing security systems and so forth. The ideal shadowrun leaves
no clue that you were ever there. The less damage you do, the better.
Generally, Johnsons want their runs done quietly, which means not following a
trail of bodies behind you for corp security to follow. Of course, if your
client wants collateral damage-- Go nuts!

Commandment #5: Take Care Of Your Sources - Your contacts are some of the most
valuable resources you've got. Take care of them and they'll take care of you.
That means protecting their identity of your sources, and not asking about
other people's (a sure sign of a newbie shadowrunner). Don't put your sources
in positions you wouldn't want to be in. If you've got a friend working for a
corp, and she passes information on to you that gets her fired, you've just
lost a contact as well as a friend. Make sure to reward your contacts for
helping you out.

Commandment #4: Do Your Homework - On the other hand, you should find out as
much as you can on your own. It's considered bad form to let a Johnson know
you're checking up on him, but it's also stupid not to do a little sniffing
around to make sure of a Johnson's motives and ties. Likewise, when it comes
to the run, do your legwork, it may save your life as well as your rep. Find
out all you can about your target before you make the run. Talk to your
contacts and find out what they know. Put together a plan in advance, and a
backup for when Plan A gets shot to hell (it almost always does). Above all,
remember that no plan ever survives contact with the enemy.

Commandment #3: Don't Ask Too Many Questions - Simple fact of life; your Mr.
Johnson won't tell you everything. He won't tell you his real name, who he
really works for or why he's really hiring you, and half the time he won't
even tell you the point of the shadowrun. Everything in the shadows is on a
need-to-know basis, and most of the time runners don't need to know. In fact,
the more you know, the worse off you are in a lot of wags; even in this day
and age, there's such a thing as "knowing too much." A Johnson who thinks
you're too much of a risk is likely to try to have you silenced, permanently.

professional, so act like one. I can't tell you how many times i've gone into
meets with runners who are fresh out of some urban hellhole like the Redmond
Barrens or El Infierno. They're usually gangers or ex-gangers accustomed to
being hot drek on the streets. They bluster, show off and play dominance games
with the Johnson, like he even cares who's the big man in the Sprawl. Most of
those runner wannabes got passed over, or worse, hired as cannon fodder for
suicide runs. Don't be stupid. Want to be treated like a professional? Then BE
professional.

First Commandment: Don't Get Caught - Rule Numero Uno of shadowrunning.
Whatever you do, don't get caught doing it. The corps may regard a certain
amount of shadowrunning as part of doing business, but don't expect that to
help you if you set off an alarm in the middle of a high-security corporate
compound. The guards won't buy "Hey, chummers, it's just biz!", and your
employer will deny ever hiring you. Runners who frag up usually die: even if
they live, their reputation will have gone down the tubes.
