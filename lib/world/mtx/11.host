Description:$
Before you floats a perfect representation of the city of Seattle. It sits
upon a huge floating stone, suspended above an endless void. The level of
detail is amazing; data streams zoom along the streets below, weaving in and
out of buildings. The Seattle LTG provides links to every number within
Seattle, and you can clearly see where the huge masses of data stream out of
the Renraku Arcology and the Mitsuhama Towers, amongst others.

Description:$
You float above an idyllic cityscape; morning birds chirp loudly from the
roofs of glass and steel towers. Clean white fluffy clouds float by you, set
in an impossibly blue sky. What appears to be cars silently skimming through
the streets are actually data packets, hurrying between the myriad hosts that
comprise the Tacoma LTG.

You fly over what seems to be a massive roadmap of the UCAS. It's a
three-dimensional version of the maps found in street directories, with major
cities and towns rising out of the otherwise flat plains. Detached from the
rest of the UCAS and floating high above the landscape is the Seattle
Metroplex.

Surrounding you is a goliath, yet idealized and golden version of the Portland

Great towers, representative of the hosts inside, match their physical skyline
counterparts, especially the Telestrian Habitat and the TTB Tower. A sea of
stars fills the sky overhead, with storm clouds that fly over at high speed,
flashing lightning forebodingly.

Chaos reigns. Flashes of light and motion momentarily gain substance, then
abrupty fade into pitch darkness or explosions of light. Noises fly past you
and off into the maelstrom, so intense they can almost be felt, insane
wailings and famous quotes mingled together. And through all this, lines of
text appear and vanish, scrolling at impossible speeds, but freezing in place
as you observe them. The only constant among all this is a single ^Wsilver^n wire
that moves like a glittering serpent before abruptly vanishing at one end.

Bright trails of light spin up into the heavens, following immense fibre optic
cables anchored to the ground of circuitry below like impossibly tall trees.
Much smaller but still huge cables tangle between the main 'trunks', creating
a series of small landings, at which the cable has been peeled back and
impromptu dataports installed. A myriad of figures moves between these points,
soaking up what information they can. A single, bright ^Wsilver^n wire winds
between this all, back onto itself and simply fades out of existance.

The representation of Everett is one of a mixture of both commercialization,
industrialization and nature, combining in a relatively eloquent manner, which
is fairly impressive considering the three clashing themes. The shimmering
waves of the virtual Puget sound glitter with a deep blue glow of swirling 1's
and 0's, undulating and crashing gently against the shores. Swathes of green
dot the landscape, marking off state parks and other memorial sites, while
other highrises and skyscrapers cleave upward into the skies, spires of
glistening steel and glass. Data trails and packets of information sail
through the skies, linking together most of the iconography offered in this
local telecommunications grid.

the landscape it attempts to envelope. Lush tropical forest areas dominate the

pouring from which are tendrils of data streams that stretch across the node
like a spiders web, interconnecting the various dots of light and sound that
are the virtual cities upon the island.
