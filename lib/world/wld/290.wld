Name:	Dead End
Desc:$
   This small cul-de-sac is occupied by several small bungalow-type
residences, all of which seem to be abandoned and in pretty bad shape.
Bottles, cans, papers and sundry trash cover the streets and sidewalks, and
the faint smell of urine fills the air.

Name:	A Small Cottage
Desc:$
   While the walls are covered in strips of peeling, moldy wallpaper and small
chunks of plaster from the ceiling are scattered all over the dirty tile
floor, this tiny cottage seems sturdy enough. A battered stainless-steel
cabinet against the east wall holds several bottles, a few mechanical arms and
legs and some disassembled electronic devices. The metal operating table in
the center of the room seems clean enough; a tray next to it holds a small
selection of surgical instruments, which seem to be soaking in some sort of
alcohol. A single fluorescent bulb dangles above, buzzing slightly.

small apartment buildings occupy this portion of the street. The sidewalks are
cracked and dirty; the street, studded with potholes. A flame-gutted building

wrecked cars sit in the middle of the road, and the smashed ruins of what used

bottle litter the sidewalks, and the road has a few potholes in it. Pedestrian
traffic is still fairly heavy, but the people walk hurriedly, as if trying to
reach safety as quickly as possible.

Name:	Second Street
Desc:$
   Small offices and shopfronts nestle closely together on this brightly-lit
but slightly untidy portion of Second Street. Both pedestrian and vehicular
traffic seems constantly congested around the small monorail station on the
east side of the street. An assortment of exercise equipment gleams in a shop
window to the west, and an open door to the southeast leads into a small,
smoky bar.

   This portion of Second Street is occupied mainly by medium-sized houses and
small apartment buildings. The sidewalks are clean and well-lit, and are never
fully deserted - no matter what time of the day or night. A vacant lot to the
east has been fenced and converted into a small playground.

   This portion of Second Street marks the border between Auburn and the
industrial neighborhood of Renton, which can be reached via Weisman Drive, to
the south. The squat brown building that houses the Auburn Lone Star precinct,
which has jurisdiction over Renton as well, is to the west. The buildings here
are a mix of mid-sized apartments and light commercial storefronts.

   This neat, brightly-lit store looks like a typical Triple-D franchise:
white linoleum floors, halogen ceiling lights, walls full of advertisements
for various grooming and medical products. The merchandise is displayed on the
metal shelves that span the shop, and in cases on top of the stainless steel
counter that stretches the length of the store. Some mild, inoffensive string
arrangement of a contemporary pop song plays over the store's sound system.

suspects and random citizens move in and out of the clean, graffiti-free
building. A heavily-reinforced metal door leads west into the building, and
the street is to the east.

   Neglect, vandalism and probably a wide array of weapons and explosives have
left their mark on this long-abandoned building. While the simple, one-room
structure still seems to be relatively structurally sound, the walls are
covered in filth and graffiti, and the floor is barely visible under a thick
layer of synthwood splinters, spent ammunition casings and broken glass. The
entryway smells of rotting food, urine and cheap alcohol. The shattered
remains of what might have once been pews stand to the south, and the street
is back to the north.

   The neat rows of synthwood seats and kneeling pads that once flanked the
central aisle are a thing of the past. Most of them seem to have been chopped
up, piled together and used as fuel for a huge bonfire, the ashen remains of
which still lie heaped in the center of the area. The occasional metal bracket
is visible under a thick layer of dirt, trash and cinders, marking where the
neat rows of seats and kneeling pads once stood. The air is still, musty, and
thick with dust, ash and rot. The entrance is to the north, and the ruined
building continues to the south.

foul-smelling liquid that bears absolutely no resemblance to baptismal water;
used condoms, fast-food wrappers and the occasional wood chip drift on its
dark, oily surface.

mold and urine fill the still air.

corner hums silently to itself.

tiled ground is cracked and broken and the walls have long since been peeled
and graffitied by local gangers. A relatively new, albeit graffitied, sign has
been erected by the non-working escalators.

   The surveillance room has lots of monitors showing all the security cameras
spread around the facility. A huge control board of some kind with controls
over each camera rests directly under the monitors. A box of donuts and a can
of coke sits on top of the control board. A guard is sleeping in the chair
next to the board.

some burned out bonfires can be seen around. The whole warehouse has decayed,

Name:	A Hallway
Desc:$
   A typical office hallway: bright fluorescent lights, tan walls covered in
framed pictures of various Lone Star graduating classes, all smiles and dress
uniforms. The brown tile floor is shiny and clean, and the area smells faintly
of ammonia.

Name:	A Reception Area
Desc:$
   This small, bare area is half-hallway, half-reception area. A small sofa
sits along the east wall, next to the door, with a battered coffee table full
of outdated magazines in front of it. An intercom speaker hangs from the west
wall. Two doors lead to the north and the south, and the hallway is to the
east.

Name:	An Office
Desc:$
   This large office is dominated by a 180-degree picture window along the
north, west and east walls, which looks out onto the city of Auburn. Another
window in the south wall, next to the door, looks out into the hallway. A
large oak desk sits in the middle of the room, in front of a luxurious leather
office chair. A small, book-filled shelf sits in the southwest corner, and the
rest of the wall space is taken up by framed plaques, awards and
commendations.

Name:	An Office
Desc:$
   Though the walls and floor are the same shades of tan and brown, softer
halogen ceiling lights have replaced the usual fluorescent tubes. A small
glass cabinet next to the door contains several trophies and medallions, and
the walls are hung with framed citations and awards. A window next to the door
provides a view of the hallway, and a window in the south wall, behind the
synthwood desk and leather chair in the room's center, looks out over the
city.

Name:	Andes Mountains
Desc:$
   You're standing on top of a tall mountain. It's a cold and crisp night, and
the pitch black sky is lit up by thousands of bright stars. The stars light up
some of the mountains, and you see silhouettes of snow covered tops against
the dark red western horizon. Sound cannot reach this place, and it's very
peaceful and relaxing, almost like you're in another world.
