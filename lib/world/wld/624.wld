Name:	Passing the management office
Desc:$
   Paving stones are lined up along this path as it makes its way towards and
past the management offices here at Pelagie waterfront apartments, which is
lined along each side with old wooden logs settled into loose gravel and beach
rocks. The apartments themselves appear to be boat houses that can be rented
out for extended periods if the lease holder plans on staying in town for a
while. A small building off to the west side of the path has a "Management"
sign hanging above the doorway, while across the path from it is an open
doorway with a sign above it which reads, "Laundry Room".

Name:	In the Pelagie Apartments management office
Desc:$
   This office is dedicated to the management of the apartments, where
potential renters can look over lease information and discuss the details of
their contracts. The office itself isn't that large, having just enough room
to fit several locked filing cabinets, a computer stashed away in the corner
and the managers desk, upon which sits a small trideo set with the volume
turned down low, and the few windows that the building has have the blinds
drawn closed.

Name:	In the laundry room
Desc:$
   This laundry room has been set up for lease holders at the apartments,
namely because there is no real way to wash ones clothes with the way the boat
houses are set up, aside from using the ocean. There seem to be a few small
stalls with showers set up in them as well off towards the back, offering a
bit of privacy when being used. Several stacked machines of both washers and
dryers are set up along the far wall, which appear to be plenty enough for all
of the residents to use.

Name:	On a walkway between boats
Desc:$
   Solid ground gives way to a system of linked wooden platforms, which are
quite sturdy but float free on the water as they extend out off of the shore.
On either side of the platforms are thick poles driven down into the sea bed
beneath, which they're tied to an anchored down so they don't go anywhere
during rough weather. However, there is a bit of movement to them as they're
walked on, so hopefully you have your sealegs ready. Slip 1 is located on the
western side here, while Slip 2 is on the east.

   While it isn't one of the most luxurious households around, it certainly
beats sleeping on the street. This boat house offers enough room to stretch
out and get comfortable, and even a troll would feel welcome and not have to
worry about snagging their horns on the ceiling. All of the basic
accomodations are offered, with a limited water feed for a sink in the half
kitchen, along with an electric stove. A pull down bed can be stored away into
the wall to offer a bit more space, and there is a folding table that does
much the same.

   While it isn't one of the most luxurious households around, it certainly
beats sleeping on the street. This boat house offers enough room to stretch
out and get comfortable, and even a troll would feel welcome and not have to
worry about snagging their horns on the ceiling. All of the basic
accomodations are offered, with a limited water feed for a sink in the half
kitchen, along with an electric stove. A pull down bed can be stored away into
the wall to offer a bit more space, and there is a folding table that does
much the same.
