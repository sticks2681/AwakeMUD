Name:	Interstate 5, Skirting Puyallup Barrens
Desc:$
   Off to the southeast a ways the Puyallup Barrens pollute the skyline in all
their fetid glory. An all around hell hole, it comes as both a relief and
sometimes inconvenience that the I-5 gingerly avoids a direct route through
the Barrens, as if its makers foresaw the pit of hell Puyallup would be today.

Desc:$
   Interstate 5 sidesteps the Puyallup Barrens, a dark district where the
shadows are deep and numerous; paradise to some, hell to others. The I-5 runs
southwestwardly through some more rural and lightly populated upper class
residential areas, until it reaches Fort Lewis, where it again curves
southward.

   There are a great many dead buried here. With the reoccurence of magic,
such mass terminations leave psychic scars on the landscape, to the extent
that mages and shamans have been known to go insane from extended contact. The
area the provides the best spell components also provides the greatest risk;
such is the life of the magician.

Name:	Gnarl's Shoot to Kill custom firearms
Desc:$
   This is the hidden workstation of Gnarl, a quickly up-and-coming face in
the world of custom firearms. Empty clips, ammo creation kits, unfinished
firearms, and damn near every gun part imaginable is strewn about behind his
makeshift counter. Numerous completed weapons are hung up on racks behind the
counter as well. Schematics and blue prints are scattered all over the
multitude of metal desks positioned in rows at the back of the shop, and
there's also a neat little pile of datachips, also most likely containing more
weapon designs. Posters reading "Shoot to Kill" in various text styles, some
of them even intricately painted, adorn the walls. Despite the name however,
the ammo shop which lies to the west has a selection of non-lethal ammo. The
shop itself seems a little disorganized, but from the looks of the completed
weapons... The owner knows exactly what the hell he's doing. The Vindicator
minigun mounted on the ceiling also seems like it was custom designed for
maximum security performance.

Name:	Shoot To Kill's ammo shop
Desc:$
   This area is tended by Gnarl's most trusted assistant, Firefly. She deals
with creating and selling the ammo for all of the weapons. Despite the
organizations name of 'Shoot To Kill', they do have an assortment of
non-lethal ammo available. This room seems a little more organized than
Gnarls, but has the same general look. Several metal tables of organized ammo
creation kits sit in the back of the room. Instructions on the careful
tailoring of each individual ammo type, and class are also scattered about.
Full loaded clips line the walls, along with several 'Shoot to Kill' drawings.
Another Vindicator minigun is mounted on the ceiling here, to calm any urges
of theft or hostility.

Desc:$
   This area was hit hard by the earthquakes in '29. While none of the area
has truly recovered from it, no one bothered with this section. Most of the
houses are completely destroyed, and the buildings that provided the services
and products for the community are shattered. Nothing has been salvaged.

   A blackened hallway leads into the heart of the building. Rubble and
plaster covers the floor in dense dust and crumbled foundaries. Dripping water
runs down your neck, chilling your spine even more than the whistling air that
passes through the bullet holes in the wall next to you.

Name:	An Auditorium
Desc:$
   A large auditorium opens out of the rubble and expands outwards. Several
groups of people, all dressed in black and red stand chattering, and as you
realise whose gang colours you've just seen, you immediately reach for your
gun and dive into the shadows.
