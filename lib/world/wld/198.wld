Name:	The Bridge of the Truth and Reconciliation
Desc:$
   Slightly oval shaped the room is dominated by a large viewscreen showing an
enormous circular halo floating in space. Various stations are along the
outlying edge of the room controlling different aspects of the ship. In the
center is a low curved station for the commander to stand at while ordering
around his troops. The symbols on the workstations are foreign and obviously
not human. Blue lighting cloaks the space in deep purple shadows adding to its
elegance and smooth flowing lines.

Name:	Rolling down along the conveyor belt
Desc:$
   You just had to follow the conveyor belt to see where it lead to, didn't
you? Well congratulations, you've successfully managed to cram yourself into
line between finished products being transfered downstairs for shipping. What
you didn't count on was the much rougher treatment the products could
withstand, and unfortunately your puny little body doesn't seem to be holding
up nearly as well. The lower you transcend the smaller the space gets, and the
tighter the space inbetween products is, until eventually your torso and the
rest of your body is being constricted. The pain begins to become almost
unbearable, but thankfully due to being slowly crushed you're aphixiated and
lose conciousness due to the massive amounts of pressure being exerted on your
body, the real pain doesn't begin until afterwards. Eventually the production
line workers halt the process and begin scraping whats left of you out of the
belts, and in turn ship the pieces to DocWagon.

care about that, instead their eyes are fixed upon the displays. A four foot

imaginable, while trid units on the wall list specs and show demonstrations in
both practical tests and in-field uses. Next to the cash register in the rear
of the store and behind the counter sits the proprietor of the weaponry retail

   The security here takes it up a notch, there are a handful of guards that
stand on either side of twin metal doors, which span a good eight meters

ceiling and two more flank the guards, giving an incredibly huge amount of
firepower to point down either corridor. The door itself has no visible
unlocking mechanism, and neither of the guards has anything that is out of the
ordinary. The ceiling is lined with recessed lighting hidden behind
shatter-proof plasteel. Emergency lights line the corridor, transecting it

walls are clean and smooth, they've been polished to a glass-like sheen for
some unknown reason. The space is oddly devoid of autocannons in, stark
contrast of the surrounding areas.

Desc:$
   The room is nothing more than a steel lined shooting gallery. A series of
sensors wrap around the room, scanning the internal IDs of all employees, as
well as running an x-ray scan and a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). A trio of
autocannons hang down from the roof near the northern exit. Both exits are the
same, spanning a good eight meters across, both with retractable steel doors
that seal off the inner space during security checks. The southern door is
atleast a foot thick, and as it seals shut an almost inumerable number of
latches sound the door locking itself firmly into place.

Desc:$
   This section has been left empty for the most part. A wall to the north
blocks most of the view of the monitoring station, while the wall itself is an
oddity, which has a few slits in it at about average human waist height. It
takes a moment but you realize that this wall is used to defend the entrance
to the command center beyond it, should the outer security checkpoints ever be
breached. The ceiling is visably lower in the command center compared to the
hallway that grants access to it. This has either been done to help protect it
against outside attacks or to allow it to hide suprises for anyone stupid
enough to try and storm their way in.

   The feel of the command center changes drastically as you enter this
section, which is removed from the rest of the area by two large walls that
almost completely seal it off. This area has been reserved for the comfort of
the security crew, apparently, and has a number of bunk beds that line the
south and west walls. A refresher station, including a full shower, has been
set up and a few small doors look to lead into changing rooms. A single couch
and coffee table are set up in a small sitting area near an just as small
kitchen that is really nothing more than a sink, a refrigerator/freezer combo
and a microwave for nuking frozen burritos.

   This section of the command center is the staging area, it has multiple
lockers that line the walls and have various markings, ranging from
"Ammunition" to "Explosives" and even "Riot Control". The space is quite
large, easily allowing a large number of security personel to equip themselves
quickly and efficiently. A pair of flat black sliding doors are almost lost in
the corner, which seems to lead to an elevator that is secured against most
unwarranted intruders.

crimson red color at the bottom and slowly moving to a sky blue at the very

   Man, traffic is really backing up around here near the I-405 Interchange.
There are several signs over the highway explaining which lanes go to what
freeway and which to be in for the north or south direction. While it has been
plagued a lot due to construction it appears that several new lanes of the
north interchange have recently been opened up, though the leftovers of
construction workers and their equipment is still an eyesore in the area since
they aren't finished their work yet.

Desc:$
   Here the I-405 cuts through the I-90 running north and south, there are
several unfinished overpasses, onramps and offramps around here as the
constuction on the I-405 continues. Traffic here has slowed to a crawl as
everyone and their mother take a moment to look at the various things around.
Not too far to the east are the Redmond Barrens and near by to the west is
Council Island.

   The moment you enter the room a camera trains on your position and follows
your every move. The large security desk just to the left of the elevator
dominates the room as do the two heavily armed guards standing in front of the
heremtically sealed doors. A large ^YYellow^n and ^LBlack^n Radiation sign warns you
to not enter without proper protection. The lock on the door is a combination
key card, hand print reader. There is a small rather flimsy looking wooden
door to the right that has a plaque on it reading "Containment Suit Storage"

   The room around you is circular with two large 3 foot thick hermeticaly
sealed steel doors. A small camera watches the room and you. A few moments
after entering a red alarm light above you begins to flash as the air within
the room is swapped and your body is sterilized. After about 5 minutes of
sterelization process the lock cycles and the door slides open.

anything more than a time delay as it has yet to be built. The area around

The traffic is quite heavy to the west but as you move east it is thinning out
quite a bit.

   Your gridguide beeps informing you that you are on the fringe of the
gridguide, which seems to signify you have reached the edge of civilization.
The road around here is in a terrible state, with large cracks in it and major
pot holes. This is the edge of the Redmond Barrens, and man, if you can't tell
by the landscape the smell ought to have tipped you off.

   The road takes a turn for the worse around here if thats even possible. The
road is filled with blast holes and the plants seem to glow. Off to the north
you can make out the cooling tower for the old Glow City power plant. Best not
stay here long unless you want to get radiation poisoning.

are covered in highly tinted class, the metal supports between them a highly
polished silver. Foot traffic around the base is heavy and never endings as
corporate execs head towards meeting and families towards the large shopping
mall housed in the base of the tower. Despite the constant foot traffic the
area is exceptionally clean and well kept. A small sign hangs over the
entrance to the tower that reads "All Are Welcome in this Place" in rather
large, friendly letters, even though the Knight-Errant standing guard seem to
suggest otherwise.

the Knight Center shopping mall listening to some old school rock music from
back in the 1980's. The band onstage is reminiscent of AC/DC from back in the
day, with the long hair and clothing style. Twin eight foot tall speaker
towers blare out the music for all to hear, at least those close enough to not
have the sound droned out by all the hustle and bustle. Nestled back into the
wall the stage actually serves as the display for the Hard Rock Cafe behind
it.

that pump out the trance-like music for all in the area to hear. Behind the

her surroundings with general disinterest. The gray carpet is plush and feels
comfortable under your feet. The walls are two-tone with the lower half being
a crimson red color and the upper half a crushed gold.  The two halves are
separated by a black stripe of crown molding. The words "Ares Macrotechnology"
are written in old English lettering over the arched doorway that leads deeper

its industrial grade off-blue carpeting and white walls you almost feel as
though you're in an institution for the mad. There are solid birch doors on
either side that lead into the offices of some of the Knight Centers elite.

Desc:$
   One of the halogen lightbulbs in this section of the hallway seems to be on
the brink of going out. It flickers and flashes irregularly, annoying the
passers by. A fire alarm is mounted to the wall here, giving some colour to
what would otherwise be a very plain looking hallway.

Name:	Damien Knight's Office
Desc:$
   A large and rather lavish office by any means. The rear portion of the
office is curved slightly and made entirely out of clear plasteel, allowing
for a grand view of the city below. A large maple desk sits in the middle of
the room with four large, comfy looking chairs in front of it and a plush
executive chair behind it. Along the left side of the room is a large book
shelf that takes up the entire wall. Near the shelf is two leather recliners,
a leather couch and a small table with a lamp on it. The opposing wall is
dominated by a massive TRID screen with theatre like seating in front of it.
Currently on the TRID screen is a rotating ARES logo. Just to the left of the
main entrance is a single door that appears to lead to toiletry facilities. On
the desk resides a rather old looking chess set, which is missing the black
king.

of even imaginable has been hosted. A somewhat small wood desk has been

her computer. A camera monitors you from the time you enter this floor to the
time you leave, excluding when you enter one of the apartments.

composed of drop tiles of a neutral grey color. A pair of sliding bullet proof
glass doors lead deeper into the level.

   The room is almost boring, looking at first to contain nothing more than a
single oak receptionist's desk and hidden lighting in the roof. The walls are
a bland looking grey colour that barely stands out with the black carpet, that
is until you take a closer look and realize that the entire wall is shifting
and moving with every moment. The walls slowly shift, taking on new forms and
schematics, displaying all of the advancements in Nanotechnology. Yet the room
shifts dramatically once you leave the landing and enter the main hallway from
form to function, the hallway itself being done in an industrial grade tile
and rather bleak paint scheme.

   The elevator is just about the only part of this landing that isnt made of
glass. The walls are lined with vats that run from floor to ceiling and bubble
while they cast off a haunting yellow-green glow that dominates the room.
Within each of the tube floats some sort of bioware from adrenal pumps to
suprathyroid glands and even up to full on replacement body parts, as well as
several things you've never seen before. In one corner is a small desk behind
which the receptionist for the floor sits and just a little to the left is a
huge hermetically sealed door that keeps the main research floor free from
contamination.

Name:	Sublevel Parking Garage - At the Elevators (Basement Level 1)
Desc:$
   The temperature here is a good few degrees lower than the rest of the
building due to being completely underground. The walls are solid concrete as
is the floor. Grooves are cut into the floor giving the garage road that
trademark squeal sound as well as allowing for water drainage. The simple
lighting in the area causes it to throw rather ghoulish images along the
walls.

Name:	Sublevel MonoRail Station - At the Elevators (Basement Level 2)
Desc:$
   The cavern that houses the station is huge with a roof, carved into
shadowed steppes, arching high overhead. A trio of monorail lines intersect
the mammoth space dividing it into two large areas with a monorail platform
along either wall and a single track down the middle. Ornate tiles cover the
floor giving it a very upscale look while the massive lights that hang from
the ceiling cast a warm yellow glow over the entire space. A huge virtual
bulletin board hangs in the air listing the schedules of the different lines.
People cover the entire floor and the endless drone of their voices is only
broken as the PA system announces the arrival of a new train as it rumbles
into the station.

   This area is quaint and rather impersonal as far a rooms go, it has rather
stark white walls and industrial grade carpeting that crunches under your
feet. To the right of the elevator is a very tidy desk, behind which sits the
receptionist for the floor, who smiles at you as you walk past before quickly
going back to her work. The room is lit by halogen lights that are recessed
into the ceiling that helps to keep the white walls from becoming blinding.

Desc:$
   Plush doesn't even begin to describe this landing, it looks almost like it
was taken from a 17th century victorian house. The molding and architecture
are very ornate and covered in gold leaf. The walls are done with a base coat
of white, and was then covered with a cream colour that gives the walls a very
marble like apperance. The floor is covered in a plush red carpet, and there
are several small armchairs spaced around the room, which look quite inviting
in stark contrast to the twin autocannons that are mounted to the ceiling over
the hall that leads deeper into the floor.

   This floor is almost identical to the one just below it. The walls are
washed in a high-gloss egg-shell white, that when paired up with the
incredibly clean white floor and ceiling make it all but impossible to keep up
sorted from down in the space. The only only bit that seperates the floor from
the ceiling is the high powered fluorescent lighting that adds a cold and
calculating feel to the floor. The dull whir of robotic appetures and conveyer
belts fill the air with an almost calm reverberation.

sporting some serious security on them. Although the room looks completely
unmonitored at first, there seem to be quite a few cameras positioned around

hard to distinguish. About the room are a number of monitors that constantly
play back clips from Ares reporters in the midst of major events. The sounds
have all been muted to keep the space from being filled with audio chaos,
instead a rather soothing song slowly echos in an almost ghostly fasion
through the area, putting most at ease when they enter.

   The room has a very industrial feel with parts of the steel support system
coming out of the walls. The utility lines run in exposed steel pipes that
gives the space an almost uncompleted feel. The walls are concrete with the
floor being a beige tile. The lighting is very mine like with rock guards
covering them all. Occasionally there is a mounted turret on the roof
following the theme of hightened security on this floor.

   SMG heaven is a good way to describe this place. The walls are lined with a
huge number of SMGs almost all of which bear the ARES Logo. One feature that
makes the shop different from all the others is a mini shooting range that
allows prospective buyers to test the weapon. In a glass case behind the
counter is a prototype of a long range SMG that is currently in development.

capture perfectly the sound of the shells as they clink onto the floor.

   The room is plain and lacking the usual flash of the other stores found
here in the Knight Center. Apparently the owners of the shop believe that the
merchandise will speak for itself, and oh boy, does it ever. The Ares Vigorous
assault cannon that hangs on the back wall has been chrome-plated, giving it a
flash yet deadly look to it. Several other cannons and heavy weaponry are
under lock and key in thick, reinforced glass display cases. A large diagram
on the wall shows a cannon broken down into all of its parts and a brief
description on the basic functions and workings of the hand-held piece of
artillery. A bit of noise eminates from the back room, whos doorway is ajar,
but roped off by a rather large and burly meat door of a guard.

who where so satisfied with their purchases that they wanted to show the rest

trids in the back show footage of people shooting the rifles at various types
of targets. The pride and joy of the shop lies in a display case on the left
side of the store. It's a huge .50 cal long range sniper.

Desc:$
   Huge vats of bio goo house all types of body parts and unrecognizable
items. There are larger vats in the back the store that hold the large pieces
of bioware. A few shoppers look at the different items floating in the tanks
as they wander about. The large operating table in the middle of the room is
surrounded by a steralization chamber to help keep the bio components sterile.

the walls and an intricate arrangement of trusses support the weight of the
floor above. Circular gas lights hang from long tubes of conduit humming
lightly. Along the ceiling are a large number of secondary trusses suspended
from wenches upon which are a large number of spotlights. Booths have been set
up crowding the once open space with an flood of people all looking to buy the
next big thing. Hanging over the entrance is a large banner which reads
"International Corporate Security Expo".

   Packed in like sardines there are booths of all shapes and sizes. Vendors
yell out slogans and demonstrate their products trying to persuade the
unsuspecting masses into buying into their product. Bright colored banners and
loud music fill the space and the vast undulating sea of people fill the area
to claustrophobic levels. Their chatter is only broken by the occasional
automatic or semi-automatic gun fire which resonates off the walls making it
nearly impossible to tell the exact direction it came from.

   Ares has set up a large booth here that runs the length of the presently
empty stage. The large red banner hanging over the booth reads "Dreamed of
joining the ranks of the Knight-Errant? Well now is your chance!" Large TRID
units display the exploits of various KE on the job site. Several show them
assaulting a complex and laying waste to those help up inside, while others
display them on patrol deep inside corporations protecting valuable secrets.
Still others show them out walking the streets, one picture showing a team of
four stationed outside of the Dante's Inferno night club in downtown Seattle.
Currently all the representatives are busily discussing all the available
positions and opportunities within the KE that are available.

Name:	Before a large stage
Desc:$
   The vaulting space of the stage yawns into view.  Red satin curtains
obscure the interior where the production crew has to be scrambling for the
next demonstration.  The metal frame of the stage has a stark and military
appearance with none of the usual filigrees and decorative additions.  There
is a shifting holo at the corner of the stage giving a preview of the shows
and their expected times.  A few people mill around the table where some
crackers, cheese, fruits and veggies are laid out with pitchers of water.

   Packed in like sardines there are booths of all shapes and sizes. Vendors
yell out slogans and demonstrate their products trying to persuade the
unsuspecting masses into buying into their product. Bright colored banners and
loud music fill the space and the vast undulating sea of people fill the area
to claustrophobic levels. Their chatter is only broken by the occasional
automatic or semi-automatic gun fire which resonates off the walls making it
nearly impossible to tell the exact direction it came from.

   Huddled masses pack in around this booth desperate to get close enough to
see what is being displayed. A very proud looking Knight-Errant holds a
positively deadly looking pistol in his head, which the banner overhead
identifies as the Ares Predator IV. Several rounds belch from the gun and
shatter the supposedly bullet proof glass. The Knight-Errant goes on to
explain that this gun will be one of the first to feature the wireless
smartlink system that Ares has had in development. Laying on the table are
sheets allowing you to request more information on the gun and what to do in
order to be put on the pre-order but all the spots have been filled.

   Here the newest version of the biolock system is being demonstrated to all
that will stop for a moment to watch. One of the men fires a gun at a target
several times and then hands it off to another who attempts to repeat the
action but is unable to cause the gun to fire. It is explained that the gun is
modified with a safety that will only release when the biological signature
that it is registered to is present. Thusly keeping a ganger from firing a
dropped weapon.

   Bright blue banners adorn a booth here with the words "It'll drop a troll!"
written in large white letters. Apparently the unlucky bastard chosen to run
this booth actually enjoys his job and is chanting frantically at any that
will listen for a moment what his "super awesome heavy duty one of a kind stop
anything taser" can do. Though judging by the huge stack of boxes in the back
of the booth he doesn't seem to be faring very well.

   Echoes of gunshots bounce off the walls and drone out a large number of the
conversations going on around this booth where the new dragon skin armor
system is being displayed. Fully automatic machine guns lay waste to one of
the vests that current security personal are wearing causing a number to
flinch with unease but when the same weapons are fired at the dragon skin not
a single round goes through. The representative claims that the vest is so
durable that it could take a point blank explosion from a frag grenade and
provided the user didn't get hit in any unexposed areas he'd walk away.

it's complete and undamaged, as well as placing each one into a dye that
latches onto the chip and holds it perfectly stable to allow for the highly
precise procedures. The container is brushed steel and feeds onto twin belts
that allows the production of the floor to be doubled.

   This furnace differs from the other one on the floor in that is melts
plastic to a pure liquid state before secreating it into long sheets. The
plastic that is being produced from the furnace is unique in colour and
texture, their green colour and thin brittle state are the tell tale signs of
circuit boards. The sheets are about five feet wide and up to six or eight
feet long, which slowly rumble along the conveyer belt in a semi-malleable

   One of the twin conveyer belts splits off in this direction and the chip is
immediatly joined to three more blank circuit chips to make it that much
larger. The new boards are stamped and a few more pathways are added to the
existing chip. Once again all the pathways are tested and the faulted ones
removed. The chips are momentairily super heated and fused into one solid
chip, and after being cooled by a blast of liquid nitrogen, are stamped with a
third set of pathways, linking the chip together.

   The pathway of the belt is lined with robotic apetures, which are all
working at a blazing speed and with cool, inhuman precision. The first of the

circuit board. A laser passes beneath the board and slices down the contacts,
leaving just enough for them to be soldered. Other robots place in different
electronics, such as transistors, resistors and various hook-ups to allow the
cyberware to interface with it's other components.

chips are soldered tight they get a blast of nitrogen to cool them down and
solidify them. After that they are once again checked for the appropriate
resistance, before being placed back onto another conveyer belt to continue
their journey.

circle. The chips are popped up from the dyes and pushed back onto another
conveyer belt, which then continues to rumble along on their journey.

   Each chip is dropped into a small semi-circle and a number of other various
compononets are added. Robots work to get the other components wired to the
chip, while the chip itself is being attached to the half circle. An odd
looking connector is dropped into the rear of the circle and then solders them
into position. The top of the circle is then chopped off and the two pieces
are fused together to make a single solid ball about the size of a golfball.
Each completed ball is dropped into a large rack that holds one hundred balls
in ten rows of ten. The rack is then carried of by a mobile robot to the
testing area ahead.

Name:	The production line control center
Desc:$
   Located within the heart and soul of the main production line, the control
center actively monitors the position of every machine and product until it
passes down to the lower level, at which point another control center takes
over. The room is nothing more than a medium sized box with a door to either
side. A bank of seven screens monitor critical parts of each line. Three of
them are devoted to the primary, another three to the secondary, and the last
one watches the line as it moves to the lower level. The room is rather clean
and most of the equipment still has some gleam to it, setting it apart from
the incredibly clean space outside. Slanted banks of controls are linked to
the various robots on the floor that work with quick, automated precision to
bring each piece one step closer to completion. Touch screens on the controls
allow the operators to preform diagnostics, rudimentary maintenance and simple
manual controls.

   Along here robots pull the various chips off the conveyer belt and plug
them into units that simulate the chips final resting area. The area is filled
with the constant tone of test cycles finishing as the chips that fail are
placed on a seperate conveyer belt, which takes them off to a seperate room
where human hands will look over them to determine where the failure is, or if
the chip can be salvaged. Once the first round of testing is completed the
chips are placed back on the conveyer belt to be taken to the second testing
area.

   This chips are once again pulled off of the belt and placed into small
containers, the containers themselves are then heated to one hundred degrees
centigrade, then immediately chilled to negative fifty degrees centigrade,
where they are left to warm up to room temperature. The chips are then pulled
from the containers and retested, with their results checked back against the
results of the earlier tests. If they pass with a margin of difference less
that 1% they are then placed back on the belt to head off to packaging.

Name:	A meeting of the production lines
Desc:$
   The two production lines converge here before traveling northward in a set
of parallel tracks. The final process of this floor is to scan each products
barcode and feed in into the computer. This barcode allows it to be tracked
once it goes down to the next floor, as well as throughout the entire shipping
process. One machine engraves the barcode onto each piece and the next reads
it, all while another robotic arm pulls the ones that fail from the line to be
read correctly for further human review.

   Human workers select three balls from the racks at random and connect them
to testing devices linked to the central computer. The screens near them show
the running of diagnostics and a list of results. With the flick of a switch
the screen changes to a view of the area from an alternate perception, and you
realize they're making cyber eyes. Once the test is complete the eyes are
returned to their racks, which are then placed onto a conveyer belt leading
down to packaging.

   The words "High Security" have been printed on the doors in white letters
overlayed on a red stripe that transect's the door about 2/3rds of the way up
its length. A trio of armed guards stand watch on this side of the door double
checking those that come through and ensuring that those who are leaving
haven't picked up anything extra that they shouldn't have. The most startling
feature of this room is that at the ends of the long rows of computer servers
and banks you can make out large windows that give a 360 panorama of the city
surrounding the Knight Center.

dedicated to the internal workings of the Knight Center. The dull hum from
their cooling fans and the soft whirl of the air conditioning give the space a
natural reverberation that is as soothing as it is annoying. The severs are
encased in sleek brushed aluminum rackmounts white the computer units
themselves are a flat white color each with a blue LED display adding to the
slick look and polished feeling of the space.

above most of the rooftops. The city streatched ut before you almost as far as
the eye can see. The interstate is easily found, the headlights of cars like

to the left is lit up rather brilliantly with light radiating around it as if
the entire thing were glowing.

in that row. Everything from space remaining on the hard disc to the
temperature of the CPU itself. The screen is a touch screen and by selecting a
specific server unit detailed specs can be brought up showing the traffic over
a given time and the last known issue with the unit. The windows continue
along this wall but thick blast shields have been lowered completely blocking

   As the rows of servers continue it becomes nearly impossible to keep track
of the number of high powered servers that are running in this room. A ladder

ceiling tiles have been pulled down. The gaping hole in the ceiling reveals
the yellow fiberglass insulation in the roof as well as large conduits that
carry the fiberoptics cabling that allows the lightning fast transfer of
information within the tower. One of the conduits has been sliced open and a
number of the wires cut to allow new wires to be spliced in.

   The Zurich Multibank building fills the vast majority of this window's view
of the city. The space is rather uninteresting to the eye except for a large
building rising to the south-east. The Yamatetsu SeaTac Plaza's tower rises
from the skyscrapers and contains about itself a beauty almost comparable to
that of the Knight Center itself. Despite the somewhat odd name of the
building it is quite impressive standing out compared to nearly all the other
buildings around due to its spire like design. The foot traffic through the
street below is quite heavy though from this height the entire thing looks
like one large pulsating mass never ending as it flows on through the city
like blood through veins.

Name:	At a computer station
Desc:$
   This computer station is much like its cousin on the west side of the
building being nothing more than a keyboard and mouse on a desk while the
actual screen of the computer is projected onto a large screen. This station
looks to have been accessed the normal screen saver of the rotating ares logo
vanished to be replaced with the last search string reading "Fiscal Reports"
and the mystery fades almost instantly and turns quite boring.

Name:	A large bank of storage cells
Desc:$
   This bank of cabinets is made of a cedar that is somewhat aged looking the
varnish on it worn from age. The steel grate covering access to the cabinet
has been rubbed silver at the handle and the units inside have a LED light
indicator of capacity usage rather than the new age LCD display. Each unit
consumes two rack spaces and hum at such a low frequency that you can't hear
it but you can feel the floor vibrating slightly. Old style key locks keep the
doors shut tight.

   The large cabinets full of hard drives end suddenly here in the middle of
the floor. Along the floor there are a few bolts in square patterns sticking
up suggesting that at some point more units had been here extending the row
further along the length of the building but for some reason have been filled
and rather hastily at that judging by the ceiling. The points where the
bundles of wire had run up through the false ceiling are still apparent and a
number still have all the cable dangling from them wrapping in lazy coils on
the ground.

   A computer station comprised of a small desk and chair dominates the space
here a large projector mounted in the roof displays a large rotaing Ares logo
on the screen hung between the station and the memory banks. The computer is
connected to its row of memory banks allowing access of the backed up material
as well as the actual process of backing up data from the current system. The
large size of the screen serves a dual purpose allowing a large number of
files to be looked through at once as well as giving the security cameras a
nice large picture to look at.

   To either side are large synthetic maple cabinets that stand about eight
feet tall and are secured with mesh grate coverings. Within the cabinets is
what appears to be a black abyss but closer inspection reveals that is it
naught but more computer equipment. Each unit occupies a single space and is
completely free of markings except for an LCD display that shows a shaded bar
and a percentage. All the units along this space read 100%. This room is
notably different from the southern section of the floor because these units
make almost no sound and while there is a significant breeze through the room
the sounds of an air conditioning system are absent.

   The row of large cabinets comes to and end here just a few feet away from
the edge of the tower. The bright light of the sun blocked out by the blast
shields that have been extended. The cabinet at the very end of the row is
open and one side is full while the other is empty. A large box on the floor
contains more of the rack mount storage drives that these cabinets are stuffed
full of. Large loops of cable rest on the bottom of the cabinet waiting to be
connected so another years worth of data can be backed up and the current
system cleaned and rebuilt.

Desc:$
   A small space has been cleared near this window for an open air office. A
single brushed steel desk faces away from the window deeper into the tower. A
pair of small bookshelves serve as low walls to the east side of the desk. A
filing cabinet and small trash can serve a similar purpose on the other side
of the desk giving the owner of the office some feeling of a defined space and
minimal privacy. Twin computer screens are centered on the desk and
continuously scroll by two different sets of information. Neither a keyboard
nor a mouse are present on the desk or any form of identification aside from a
small placard that says "Director of Information Services" The city scape
outside the window is quite spectacular with the grand skyline of Seattle
rising on the horizon. The most notable shapes are the outlines of the
Novatech building, the Renraku Archology and the Aztechnology pyramid.

   The hallway is rather large, about twenty feet across and perfectly
straight, while along the middle of the wall is a black bar that seems to
contain some form of monitoring equipment. The odd thing about this floor is
that although it appears clean it doesn't seem to be used. The overhead
lighting flickers in a few places and dark shadows are cast in areas where a
bulb has given off its last light. Some of the covering over the sensor bars
have large cracks running down them, and open spaces where the delicate
interior is exposed.

   The hallway here is in a similar condition to the rest, aside from a pair
of deep claw marks that mar up the door to the east, which has been bent in,
making it impossible to close. Part of the sensor array that runs along the
walls has been ripped clean off and the remains are sparking continuously.
Scorch marks stain parts of the walls, as well as bullet markings. One of the
air conditioning vents has been torn from the ceiling, and there is a high
concentration of bullets markings around it.

The sensor array that runs along the wall has been shot up and sparks
randomly, throwing light around at random angles. Something about the stale
smell of the air on this floor bodes an ill will and encourages a short visit.

   Warm and slightly moist, the air is filled with the smell of blood and
gunpowder. The shattered remains of what was at one point a high security
checkpoint have been strewn about the space, and what were once guard posts
set back into the walls are now dark caverns with deep claw marks marring up
their openings. The sliding glass doors that once sealed the two sections off
from each other have been ripped free and thrown to the rear of the space. The
shape of the now empty frames suggests that they had been blown off their
tracks, and the large sections of bullet proof glass that are warped in the
same manner reinforce the idea. Scores of bullet marks and deep gouges cover
the space, as well as large lines of blood that have sprayed up against the
wall and dried while slowly dripping down. Light about the area is scarce, and
broken in areas where countless lights have burned out or lay shattered on the
ground.

   Here the hallway bends, one stretching off into the blackness, while the

form of cover from an enemy that had broken all expectations. Many of them
still stand where they had been placed but others have been ripped from their
foundations and hurled across the room, the most notable jutting out halfway
up a wall with a limp hand hanging down from it, clutching at half of a rifle.
Blood hangs on many of the walls, covering them like a layer of red paint that
has slowly trickled down to the floor. The air is thick with the smell of
death despite the lack of a large number of bodies. Parts of the security
teams that gave their lives here are still present, hands, feet, torsos and
legs. A single helmet with the face shield missing lies on the floor, the face
inside which is silently screaming out in terror against the unseen enemy.

Where a plate glass window once stood is now nothing more than a few bloody

assemblies snapped from their mounts and have fallen to the floor, creating
small craters where they now rest. The words ^W"^RNo Unauthorized Personnel Beyond
This Point^W"^N are just barely visible on the walls beneath a layer of black
soot. In places the glass has melted into the concrete, giving it a gem

of computers are white washed walls and thick steel plating to reinforce the
rooms isolation. An absolutely huge operating table and a single massive
stasis tank predominate the center of the room. Tilting slightly to the side,
the tank itself has been slightly uprooted and the glass on one side has been
blown outward. Large tubes full of silver liquid line one wall, with labels
marking their contents. A large crack runs down one of the tubes and its
contents slowly leak out onto the floor. Dead bodies of scientists are strewn
about the floor, while a large dent in a bank of computers looms over the
crumpled body of one of the more unfortunate personel.

Shattered dura-crete litters the area, breaking up the otherwise flat ground,
forming crags and valleys. Steel mountings have been forcibly removed from the
wall, revealing cut outs where autocannons and other instruments used to test
subjects once rested. The room is dominated by what once was the control center
of the room, its suspension cables have been cut  and it has fallen a good ten
meters to the floor, impacted and shattered the dura-crete in a spider web pattern.
Through the broken windows banks of monitors and control panels are visible, dark
in their off-line state. The faint wail of an emergency siren echoes about the space,
buried under the rubble. The words "Containment Breached!" are audible amongst the
static. Pock marks and scorches litter the area, which are almost as numerable as
the claw marks that seem to adorn everything, as well as the thick blueish blood
that is almost looks purple once its dried. A large steel blast door stands to the
south, which has a few odds and ends stacked up against it as a makeshift barrier.

   The northern wall is dominated by a rather large safe, whose combination
hand reader and retinal scanner keeps all but a select few from its contents.
The eastern counter is covered with a machine that takes in diamonds, and from
this produces the minute circuit boards that nanites run off of. On the
opposing counter is the specialized machine that takes the cut boards and
prints the circuitry onto them, as well as install any other items necessary
for their function, the finished product emerges as a functioning nanite. What
little free space that remains is dedicated to the banks of computers required
to code and program the nanites with the various purposes they are intended
for. Large tubes run down near the machine that produces the nanites, and upon
mixing them with plasma, ships them off to the other labs to be used for
further research.

corner of the room. Two animal-like forms float in tanks, which are putting
them into a neutral buoyancy. Large slashes have shredded parts of their
bodies, some of which have healed, leaving scars, while others are still open.
The computer banks are free of dust and grime and a printer churns out a fresh
status report. Beside the twin tubes are a series of smaller tubes, which are
filled with a viscous gray liquid. A system of tubes are connected to their
bodies, which then runs out of the main tanks and into the smaller tubes which
occasionally drain and refill. Each tank is connected to a computer monitor,
while another two monitor life signs and others give information regarding the
nanites contained in the tubes.

Name:	Before a security checkpoint
Desc:$
   The hallway is truncated to the south by a rather well defended security
point. What's odd about it is the security looks more like it's dedicated to
keeping people in the area behind the checkpoint. A single armed guard stands
on this side of a heavy steel door that retracts up into the ceiling to allow
people to pass through. Twin siren lights adorn either side of the door and
wail away when it begins to open alerting the whole floor. Other than the
checkpoint this section is much like those to the north being washed in a
green light and smelling of bleach.

Name:	A well guarded checkpoint
Desc:$
   With all the security here they look like they're ready to fight of a small
invasion. Eight autocannons hang from the ceiling 4 pointing off down each
hallway. Similarly arranged are eight troopers in heavy armor. Two more
regular looking security personnel have been given the job of actually
watching the entrance. The troopers are behind reinforced positions that has
easy access to the main door which at first seems odd but it becomes clear
that they are more worried about something coming down the hallways than
someone breaking in.

   The space is rather confined compared to the two rooms it joins but it
shows a huge amount of battle scaring. Scorch marks, bullet holes, and even
claw marks are almost to numerable to count. The dentiplast doors at either
end lift up into the roof to allow access to the space beyond. Each door is
about 1 foot thick and must weigh a huge amount. A single yellow light
provides the illumination for the space. The odd thing is there are no door
controls in the space. They are controlled from some other location for added
security. Though the door to the west has been smashed to the point where it
will most likely never move again.

Name:	Along the hallway
Desc:$
   The hallway stretches off in both directions at this point. Echoing up from
the south are the sounds of fighting as well as the occasional scream and
bloody gurgle, to the north there are few sounds just the random happy ding of
the elevator as it arrives at the floor. The walls are painted a tan color
making this one of the friendliest looking Research and Development floors in
the entire Knight Center. The floor is tile that feels like it gives a little
with each step you take.

   A ghastly scream assaults your ears as you enter the room. A crazed man is
locked away in a cage in the back. He rolls about crazily drooling and howling
as his body convulses. A few scientists stand about him with notepads, jotting
down their observations. A few other scientists work at computers researching
the next level in Move-By-Wire technologies. Another holding pen secures a
very nervous looking elf.

Desc:$
   The entrance to the first laboratory is here and it's oddly different from
the others in that it is surrounded by a glass wall allowing people walking by
to look in and see just whats going on. At the moment the space looks empty
save for a scientist or two milling about. The hallway stretches on to the
south looking almost inviting with the tan coloring and bright displays along
the western wall and the foyer is just to the north offering service to all
the other floors of the Knight Center.

The lighting is sparse and far between giving the area a relaxed feel. A small
space is set up between the two hallways, a single sofa and two arm-chairs
creat a small intimate seating area.

   Quaint and compact this room is ill suited for anything more than an
overnight stay. Jammed in one corner of the room is a rather small single bed
drapped in plain white sheets. A simple steel bedside table resides next to
it, a lamp casting a soft yellowish glow across the sheets. Just to the left
of the bed is the kitchen area, a small stovetop and a microwave over a
minifridge complete the space. Sectioned off from the rest of the room is the
bathroom. The majority of the space is consumed by the pedestal sink and
shower, the mirror over the sink doubling as the cover for the medicine
cabint.

sporting large grins. On one side is a small kitchen area with useful gadgets
built into the wall and cupboards. Up ahead, past an open door with what looks
to be a compact bathroom and shower, is the bedroom.

   As you walk through the door, you are assaulted with the stale acrid smell
of someone who sits far to long in one spot without moving and the dichotomy
of a huge luxury apartment. All the walls contain floor to ceiling shelving
units possibly containing tens of thousands of simsense chip. They range in
theme from the "Hammer: Knight Errant Detective" series of gunbusters cop
noir, to the Japanese "Imo Raeint Sa" a decade long series following the
fictional adventures and exploits of "Mlawen Ffalas" a noble prince of Tir
Tairngire. In the middle of this shrine to simsense is a luxurious SOTA
lazyboy recliner that appears to be the only item ever used in the space.
Lying next to the recliner is a high-end Bose simsense deck. You can make out
a fully automated kitchen in the distance and a number of empty rooms
collecting dust.

   The room splits here, with hallways leading off in either direction. A
small sign on the wall has an arrow pointing toward the east that reads
"Studios". The hallways are large, quite large in fact, enough to allow the
abundance of equipment to travel from area to area unobstructed. The lighting
is simple, with port lights recessed up into the ceiling, casting yellow orbs
of light onto the carpet.

   The decor here makes a drastic change, shifting from a sky blue to a dark
sage green thats accented by a white border and transects the wall at waist
level. The floor is a hard ceramic tile and is nearly black, but despite this
a number of scuff marks are still visible and occasionally there is a large
crack running through one of the tiles. The lighting is consistent, being
simple downwash flood lighting that helps give the space a somewhat open
feeling, despite the dark coloured walls.

Name:	A tiny restroom
Desc:$
   The room has been kept down to the bare minimum as far as furniture go,
leaving just a single clean sink, a toilet and a urinal. The room has a boring
grey tile floor and whitewash walls, with a single florescent light that keeps
the space from being pitched into darkness. A slightly whiter space over the
sink marks the area where a mirror once hung, but for some reason its nowhere
to be found. The soap dispenser is empty again, and it looks like someone
tried to rip the paper towel dispenser off the wall.

   Looking like a very ritzy barber shop, this room is both elegant and
functional. The perimeter is lined with mirrors and large chairs, in which
various people sit, either having make-up applied or their hair styled. The
center of the area is dominated by an island that not only provides a number
of hair washing stations, but also hair dryers as well. A large shelving unit
lines the southern wall to either side of the door, displaying the large
variety of products being used.

   The hallway terminates here into two rather sad and worn looking doors,
which at some point had been painted an earthy brown colour, but years of
abuse and neglect have left them a mixture of scuffs and exposed metal. The
placards on each door are simple, the one to the west reads "Lighting
Equipment Storage", and the one to the south reads "Sound Equipment Storage".
Overall, either door looks like it hasn't been disturbed in a while and the
complete lack of people in the area leads to the further likelyhood of the
scenario.

   Miles upon miles of cable, there are massive reels of it stacked amid boxes

out the installed lighting. A person could easily get lost in the catacomb of

the rooms, from each of which hangs a number of different lights, spotlights
to wash lights, and even a few robotics are here. The floor is covered with
high gauge lighting wire and DMX lines. A number of large road-ready cases are
marked with lighting controllers indicative of lighting boards.

   You are suddenly plunged into darkness as you enter into this room, the
overhead lighting has been dimmed down to the point where the lights are like
tiny eyes staring down. Most of the light in the room seem to be coming off
the large bank of TRID units that dominate the northern wall. Beneath these
TRIDs is a large media control station, allowing the mixing and switching of
the various inputs. Large binders are scattered about here and there,
detailing the production order for the day, while others look to be
instruction manuals for how to operate some of the equipment. The rest of the
room is left mostly open, save for a counter just to the left of the entrance
that has a small coffee pot and refrigerator on it.

of the back wall. Flanking it to one side is the large green screen used for
the weather reports, while a large truss spans the length of the room and is
packed full of lights to help make the stage bright enough for recording. The
crew is busy at work filming the current broadcast.

the rest of the floor, and it becomes clear that this is not a studio so much
as its a massive sound stage. Currently the set is dominated by a virtual
replica of Dante's Inferno, which is cut into two large pieces. The roof is a
good hundred feet up, allowing for rather large sets to be created. Scattered
about the set are lights, cameras and all forms of sound equipment. Various
networks of cables are intertwined on the floor as they all run back to the
main recording booth, which is located in a mobile station currently residing
in the back corner of the space.

scale. Instead of a single large set, a number of small green screen sets have
been erected about the space. They vary in size and shape and several are
equipped with harnesses, allowing for some acrobatic stunts. Several large
ultra-high definition cameras on mobile crane booms dot the area, looking like
giant beasts in the darkness of the space. Very few lights are on in here and
for the time being it is completely devoid of life.

carpet is soft under your feet and even the heaviest of people would have
trouble bringing about a sound with thier footsteps. The hallways are
perfectly smooth and with no obstructions of any kind, all of its curves are
gentle. A large amount of time has been taken to make the space as inviting
and undestracting as possible, as well as encourage productivity.

   The hallway is simple, yet elegant in its execution. The carpet is so deep
a crimson that its almost black, which has a border of caramel coloured marble
that continues up the wall about halfway, at which point a light tan completes
the walls and the ceiling. The lighting is low and somewhat yellowish in
color, while there is an occasional small table set up with a lamp and fern on
it to help break up the space.

Desc:$
   This room is like a virtual trip into the past, which also has quite the
old school lounge feeling. Wood paneling runs about the room up to waist
height, while the rest of the walls are painted a coffee brown with a tan
texturing done to break up the dark colour. A number of low, marble topped
tables are adorned with ferns about the room, making it feel less like an
office. The large desk in the rear is crafted from maple thats stained a deep
brown colour, which lets it get lost back against the walls. A large shelving
unit off to one side is filled with glass cases, some of which are proudly
showing off a large collection of guns from the WWI and WWII era.

crafted in the shape of a crescent and is nestled into a corner, allowing for
full view of the door without the need for large amounts of movement. A number
of display cases about the room showcase various Ares space vehicles and other

Desc:$
   A large flag of the California Free State consumes most of the back wall
here, and it certainly sets the tone for the rest of the room, not to mention
the white wash walls and light red carpeting visually pull the flag off the
wall and make it seem as though it surrounds the entire room. The desk is hard
to pick out against the walls, since its also solid white, while the most
intrusive feature of the room is the brown leather chair that sits behind the
computer perched upon the desk. Other than those two pieces of furniture the
room is relatively empty, its impeccable cleanliness hints that it is used
rarely, if ever.

   This office is rather large, but somehow retains a very personal feel to
it. The walls are a deep coffee colour that matches well with the leather
furniture. A large oak desk stained a yellowish hue sits off to one side,
breaking up the otherwise perfect symetry of the room. The desk is L-shaped,
with the longer section angled towards the large window looking out on the
city. A large bookcase on the opposite side of the room contains a number of
indian artifacts, from necklaces to arrowheads, and a large assortment of
poetry. The space is almost perfectly clean, aside from the sprawl of papers
and reports strewn across the desk that is.

come from all directions as it ricochets off of the highly reflective paint,
and the only visual cue that allows you to keep your perspective is a slightly
off white Apple logo on the far wall of the room.

photo of Ares Europe Corporate Headquarters at dusk, just as the lights are

which are causing the shifting light patterns, reminicent of the suns rays on

   The letters AGE are embossed on the back wall in silver with an intricate
golden pattern swirling away from them, which then continues to fill out the
rest of that wall. The other walls are painted a deep purple, while the floor
is mostly black with a red strip running from the door to the desk located
straight across from it. In either rear corner of the room are scale replicas
of the Eiffel Tower. The Arc De Triumph is sunk into the wall to the right of
the door, which helps complete the Paris theme.

scale model of the building rises up from the carpet, adorned with its name at
the top. The desk is nestled into a corner near where the Seattle Park is

Desc:$
   The elegance of the previous rooms continues deeper into the hallway.
Pictures hung on the walls detail the brief history of Ares from it's original
conception to where it stands today as one of the leading AAA Megacorps in the
world. The state of the hallway is impeccable, cleanliness at its finest, its
almost as though no one ever walks down it. A heavy steel door stands off to
the south, while to the east there seems to be a receptionists office.

Desc:$
   The overall design of this office was contemporary and a definitive good
use of space, it wasn't the largest of offices but seemed bigger and roomier
than it actually was due to the layout of the furniture. The receptionists
desk itself takes up the most area out of anything in here, which is set
directly in the center of the room, with the receptionist himself seated
behind it.

Name:	At a guarded security checkpoint
Desc:$
   The elegance of the previous rooms has almost completely disappeared in
favour of a high-security feel and look. The state of the hallway itself is
impeccable, cleanliness at its finest, its almost as though no one ever walks
down it. A large steel security door marks both the northern and southern ends
of this hallway, while guards in the area constantly check over paperwork of
personel to make sure they're authorized to be up here. A key piece of advice,
beyond these doors lies the security of one of the most powerful men in
existence, Damien Knight himself, so unless you have a death wish you want so
badly to come true, it would prove wise to turn back now and forget all about
your brief bout of insanity. A sign on one of the walls reinforces this idea
heavily, which reads: "^rUnauthorized personel will be eliminated with extreme
prejudice.^N" Be smart, turn back, live another day.

Name:	A split in the hallway
Desc:$
   Here the path splits off in two directions, which is primarily intended for
security reasons, this design prevents you from having a clear shot at the
door from the landing itself. The decor slowly begins to change with the
molding, becoming less and less ornate. The pictures are slowly trickling to
an end, and on the wall between the split is a TRID unit playing back Ares
commercials, it seems to be making the only noise on an otherwise perfectly
silent floor. The wall to the south seems to have been modified for security
reasons, and firing slits seem to have been constructed into the wall,
shielding the sentrys to the south.

   Twin solid steel doors rise up before you to the south. While they're
intended to provide maximum protection, time was still taken to etch the Ares
logo into the doors, as well as give them a smooth polished sheen. The door
has no visible handles and no visible key mechanism of any sort. Directly
across from the doors is a TRID unit the doubles as a touch screen. The
current message on the screen reads "Please Enter Password:" while the trio of
autocannons about the space hint at the penalty for a wrong answer. The wall
to the north seems to have been altered with firing slits for the guards here,
so they can fire beyond the wall with near impunity, basic security at its
finest.

Name:	A Brief Look at the Past
Desc:$
Ares was founded shortly after the turn of the century by Nicholas Aurelius under the name Ares Industries. Being a major American megacorp, the old United States granted special benefits to Ares. Taking advantage of this and the near-collapse of the country, Aurelius managed to purchase NASA (including all its facilities, vehicles and equipment) from the US in 2016, with the agreement that portions of it would be returned to the country in 2055. Of course, the United States had collapsed by that point.
Around 2030, Leonard Aurelius had control of Ares passed to him by his father. In 2033, Damien Knight pulled off the Nanosecond Buyout. In about a minute, he managed to acquire 22% of Ares stock. The Board, stunned by the performance, gave him the CEO position. Ares has a long-standing history of battling Insect Spirits. In 2055, the Ares subsidiary Knight Errant launched multiple attacks on Insect Spirit hives, culminating in the disaster that turned Chicago into Bug City. 
They were responsible for launching a tactical nuclear weapon at the Cermak Power Plant which wiped out the majority of the bug spirits, and for the strike using FAB Strain III to clear out the Bug City Containment Zone in early 2058.

Name:	Cranial Implantation Exploration
Desc:$
   The purposes of this room are at first glance almost confusing. Half of the
room is over loaded with computers and electronic manipulation devices, while
the other half looks like its been pulled from a cyber clinic, which has a
large operating table sucking up most of the floor space. A group of
scientists stand about the table working on a man, after a moment it becomes
clear as to their aims. This section has been devoted to the development of
cranial decks and making the biofeedback suffered by the user far less
damaging.

   There is hardly any room left in this space for people due to the massive
computing units placed here, as well as plushy looking work stations that
consume almost all of the usable floor space thats left. The sounds of fingers
tapping away at keyboards is so maddening in this space that it grinds at your
nerves. The coders placed about the room work away, designing the next new
program to hit the plex.

Name:	Encoding Advancements
Desc:$
   Simple in design and execution, this room is one of the few ones that isn't
a mess of papers. Rather large banks of computers constantly churn through
code, looking for inefficiencies or faults in the code to help make it more
productive. There is also research being done for better storage devices, to
allow chips to contain more information in the same amount of physical space.

   Like many of the other rooms on the Research and Development floor, this
one is a mess. There are reports scattered along the desks of the various
scientists, and the large white boards along one wall are full of calculations
and concepts. The big task is the design of the new CPU unit for the Apple
line of computers. With the recent release of the new OctaCore CPU, Ares is
hard at work to release their DecaCore and reclaim the market once again.

   Circuitry, thats the central idea of this room. There are a few odd looking
chairs along one wall that appear to connect to the users datajack, allowing
Ares to download their skills for use in their new line of activesofts and
knowsofts. Several of the computers are busy at work encoding information to
be used in the chips, as well as pulling out useless information and polishing
up the skills, insuring that the user gets the desired results.

Name:	Sublevel Parking Garage
Desc:$
   The space is very catacomb like. Which is an all dura-crete construction
with bare, exposed halogen lighting that gives the space its cold industrial
feel. The occasional echo of squealing tires causes you to jump slightly, and
the dripping of water encourages you to walk just a little faster. Your
footsteps echo about the seemingly endless garage..

Name:	A ramp
Desc:$
   The road takes a dive as it heads continues its trip to the Knight Center
Parking Garage. The lanes are narrow, just wide enough for a bison to squeeze
by. A tiny booth with a gate bars your entrance requiring you to take a card
to gain access. A small sign reads "Parking Free With Store Validation!"

Name:	Before a large steel blastdoor
Desc:$
   Compared to the rest of the hallway this section is barren and desolate,
nothing more than the occasional bullet ricochet has marked the walls. The
lights flicker almost rhythmically, like the beating of a heart, while long,
smeared paths of blood streak farther south into the darkness along the floor.
A good deal of rubble ahead makes it very hard to tell whats beyond.

Name:	Before a large steel blastdoor
Desc:$
   Slowly the bodies come to an end and the hallway is plunged into total
darkness. Every light has been methodically destroyed, though the rest of the
space has been left in pristine condition. A single blue light remains,
illuminating a large steel door with soft blue light. The steel reflects the
light, giving it an icy appearance, which has the black words painted on it
standing out, "NanoTech Operation Chamber". A simple keypad is nestled into
the wall to control it.

touching and trying everything out, but not buying anything.

   As each train rumbles into the station the very ground shakes, the hiss of
pneumatic brakes fills the air before the trains grind to a stop. Each set of
doors opens in sequence allowing people to enter the train, although it seems
this portion of the platform is marked off with ^Yyellow^N caution tape, with a
"^WMonorail passengers^N: ^WPlatform closed, all departures and arrivals will be
handled on the eastern platform.^N" sign planted in the midst of all the tape
webbing.
