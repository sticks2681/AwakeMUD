Name:	Candle shop entrance
Desc:$
   This small alcove is lit by a dim candle light from candalabras hung from
the wall. Although it is dimly lit, it is obvious that this quaint little shop
is kept amazingly clean. The hardwood floors creak slightly as you step, with
a slight variation of color from plank to plank.

Name:	Pillar candles
Desc:$
   The hardwood floor continues in from the entrance, squeaking with every
fourth of fifth step. Large shelves, holding what must be thousands of pillar
candles sorted by color, cover the walls. The dim candle light fills the room
gently.

Name:	Tapered candles
Desc:$
   This room is lit by candle light, as is the rest of the shop. There are
many tapered candles on display, many in candelabras made of brass or cast
iron. Each of the candles on display is made to perfection.

Name:	Airsoft Shop
Desc:$
   This store looks just about like any other gun store that you've seen,
except they sell nothing but airsoft guns. They're not actually guns, but more
like an electricly powered pea shooter, that launches little yellow BB's at
somewhat high velocities. They're not actually meant to harm someone, but if
you've got good aim, they may. They also sell a few NERF toys here as well.

Name:	Scented candles
Desc:$
   Like the rest of this quaint little shop, this corner is lit only by the
light of candles. Many candles inside of jars sit about, filling the corner
with a mixture of fragrances. Moving from one side to the other, some scents
become stronger than others.

Name:	Multicolour candles
Desc:$
   This corner of the shop is particularly colourful, somewhat more bright
than the rest of the shop. Many different candles burn here, showing the bright
and wonderful colours of these candles swirled together. Many different
variations give quite a selection for any decor.

Name:	Airsoft Ammo
Desc:$
   This is where you stock up on those little yellow bb's after you have
purchased your toy. Atleast they come with a heck of a lot of ammo for cheap,
so they're entertaining. They also sell some nerf balls and rockets for some
of the other things they sell here.
