Name:	Information Desk
Desc:$
   The first thing you notice when you enter this section of the library is
the color blue. A large counter of blue stands here, its oval shape
surrounding an information agent dressed in blue. Small stands that contain
blue brochures are spread out along the counter. Above the counter, a large
oval sign in blue hangs from the ceiling. The only saving grace is the
stylised 'i' in white, indicating that this is the information desk. The
information agent smiles towards you and asks if you need any help. Her name
tag indicates that she is known as 'Skye'. You have a strange, disturbing
feeling that her surname might be 'Blue' too...

thirst for knowledge.

Desc:$
   You enter the librarian's office. On the walls hang grand paintings of
artists long since dead - Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Donatello and
Raphael. A small painting of a turtle hangs over the doorway to the dusty
corridor. It seems a little out of place. To the southern wall stands a tall
bookshelf with many old and dusty leather bound tomes lining its shelves.

raw power emminating from the tome.

with various stands holding candles, tomes, vials and other miscellaneous
equipment required for the study of magic. A small clearing is made amongst
the equipment in which a circle is etched deep into the hard, rocky ground.
Runes are likewise etched within the circle. A blue shimmering portal hovers a
little off the ground to the north large enough for someone to walk through.
