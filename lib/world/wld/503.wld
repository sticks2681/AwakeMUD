Name:	Metro Holografix
Desc:$
   You stand in a clearing, dense tangles of junk rising on either side to
walls lined with shelves of crumbling paperbacks. The junk looks like
something that has grown here, a fungus of twisted metal and plastic. You can
pick out individual objects, but they seem to blur back into the mass: the
guts of a television so old that it's studded with the glass stumps of vacuum
tubes, a crumpled dish antenna, a brown fiber canister stuffed with corroded
lengths of alloy tubing. At the far north end of the junk-covered clearing is
a large army blanket with a very faint trail of light shining from beneath it.
From the south, through holes in the boarded-over window and door, you can
vaguely see and hear the bustle of the city.

Name:	The Backroom of Metro Holografix
Desc:$
   You stand in a white-walled room with an array of sensory equipment
positioned throughout the room. In the middle of the room are two large pylons
topped with spheres that connect to large base, which itself has a heavy duty
cord running from it to a terminal by the wall. In the northeast corner is a
clean-looking metal operating table with a selection of tools next to it. On
the southern wall hangs a large green army blanket, blocking out the outside
world.

Name:	A Dark Alley
Desc:$
   You find yourself in a dark alley, the smells of years of dirt and urine
creeping into your nose. To the north is an old storefront which the rest of
the city seems to have grown up around, its windows and doors heavily boarded
up and enforced with kevlar netting. Above the door to the store you notice a
sign that reads ^YMetro Holografix^N in big yellow neon letters.
