   You are travelling over a bridge that crosses the windy Wainoonak River.
There are sensors at fifteen meter intervals on the sides of the bridge, but
the area is desolate.  The bridge is roughly fifty meters above the river,
which is a muddy green-brown.  In another life you might consider fishing or
kayaking the river.  Oh well.

   The highway curves south to southwesterly deep here in the Sinsearach
forest. The trees in the elven tribal lands stand taller than life here,
reaching to the highest points in the sky, it seems.  The road appears
little-travelled, as the tule-mist clings to patches of the road.  Occasional
warning signs, such as "Curves Ahead" and "ICY" mark the road.

   Something appears to have gone awry here, as there is an odd glow to the
forests.  Above the trees straight southward there appears to be a column of
smoke, rising up to meet the overcast sky.  However it is impossible to
inspect from this point, as the forests are too thick.

The trees extend high up into the skies, and the dense thickets grow along

potholes are quite common, as are cracks in the asphalt.

   You are on the outskirts of the elven settlement of J'Valdi, which is
Sperethiel for "Yellow Brook".  The skies are overcast, and the hills
surrounding the town in the valley have misty wisps of clouds floating on
them, mists coming off the trees in the deep forest.  The town appears to have
a population of nearly a thousand.  It's a long ways from Seattle, chummer.

   You are on Main Street, which (logically) is the main thoroughfare through
the tiny hamlet of J'Valdi.  The town is a rustic town probably comprised of
less than a thousand.  A town like this would be drab, but each of the houses
have elegantly etched artwork adorning the walls and outsides of each of these
rather beautiful wooden houses.

Desc:$
   Main Street meets a well maintained road here, which stretches westward for
a bit with cobblestone, lined with elegantly designed wooden houses.  A
crosstreets sign marking north to south as Main and east to west as Ele'gnani
(in both English and Sperethiel characters) designates this point.  Continuing
eastward Highway 21 is blocked by a large plasticrete roadblock with a sign
that reads, "^yROAD CLOSED FOR REPAIRS^n".

Desc:$
   Main Street cuts right through the Sinsearach hamlet of J'Valdi in a north
to south fashion.  Pine trees line the sides of the road, as well as beautiful
wooden houses, artistically adorned with painted carvings. Picturesque is one
word that comes to mind.  The warm smell of smoke from woodstoves hits your
nostrils.  To your west is a postal substation, a small shop, and an Interlink
Terminal.

Name:	South end of Main Street (Highway 229)
Desc:$
   You are at the southernmost end of the Sinsearach hamlet of J'Valdi, a town
of less than a thousand.  The highway continues southward toward the infamous
Columbia Gate, the entrance to Tir Tairngire, and northward to the
Seattle-Tacoma Metroplex, a city-state of the United Canadian and American
States.  This land is a part of the Salish-Sidhe council, one of the Native
American Nations.

Desc:$
   You are on the southern outskirts just past the edge of the Sinsearach
settlement of J'Valdi.  The forests begin to densen here, as the road begins
to go up a grade.  As you get farther from J'Valdi, the road becomes more and
more worn, potholed and scarred, as very few efforts are made to make the
lesser travelled backroads through the Sinsearach reasonably passable.  If you
thought the Barrens were bad for potholes, well.  *kuh-bump*

   You are high up in the Cascade Mountains, in the south-central Sinsearach
Council region.  This windy road cuts through the side of the mountains, over
a deep canyon.  The trees stand amazingly high here, and the forests are
dense.  The road his torn up, and probably hasn't been worked on since the
Resource Rush.

   The highway goes straight-through in a northeast to southwest fashion,
surrounded by the tallest trees imaginable and the clearest skies one can
dream of.  Occasionally, you see a sign with red and black paint on it, and
indecipherable (Sperethiel?) characters.  If you want to hit the gas and gun
it, this is a good place to do it, as authorities are sparse, and so is help
if you get in trouble with the locals.

less thick.  You pass by the occasional house, trailer, cabin, and campground.
A long ways from the Seattle-Tacoma metroplex, but much closer to the elven
land of Tir Tairngire, to the south.

   You are on Mill Plain Boulevard, the main east to west thoroughfare through
the Sinsearach borough of Vancouver.  Two and three story condominiums line
the streets on both sides, showing affluence and wealth in the area.  The air
smells of smoke from woodstoves, but has a crisp clean quality to it that is

anything illegal in mind you better watch your step, as the authorities have a

Desc:$
   Mill Plain passes through a denser residential area here, with tall
apartment complexes stacked one on top of another.  You see green and black
graffiti on the wall, which looks familiar, except for the graffiti written in
Sperethiel.  You pass by many minor streets.

   Interstate 5 is the main highway that goes north to south from Seattle to
Tir Tairngire through the Sinsearach Council. Its a six lane freeway, and is
well kept. A center divider made of plasticrete sits in the middle of the
road, dividing the north and south lanes of the freeway. Directly to the south
lies the Columbia Bridge, a huge steel monstrosity constructed nearly a
century ago.

   This pair of huge steel-span bridges look to have been constructed nearly a
century ago. The two dark green bridges are identical and run parallel, a 20
meter gap seperating them. Both have been set up the same way, huge chunks of
concrete preventing a straight run across from either direction, but offering
cover from any defensive fire coming from the gate at the Portland side. Man
lights and cameras can be seen up high in the rigging, providing ample
surveillance.

Spotlights illuminate both bridges, drowning out the shadows with a greater
ferocity than the sun. Occassionaly the pointer from a laser sight sweeps
across the bridge as one of the sentries at the gate on the Portland side
sweeps his rifle accross.

Desc:$
   The Portland Wall, a 10 meter high concrete construction that surrounds the
city of Portland, stands at the southern end of the Columbia Bridge. The tank
traps on the bridge end roughly 15 meters from the gate, not leaving enough
space for any appreciable acceleration. The Tir Peace Force Border patrol keep
a tight watch on this gate, if you're going to try and get through, force
would not be the best option.

NightDesc:$
   Spotlights along the top of the Gate and the Wall flood this area, making
it as bright as day. The Tir Peace Force Border Patrol have a strong presence
here, even at night. The tank traps on the bridge end roughly 15 meters from
the 10 meter tall Multnomah Gate, the main thoroughfare into Portland from the
Sinsearach council.

Desc:$
   The ten meter Portland Wall towers over you to the north of here. Topped by
a variety of concertina and monowire, and heavily patrolled, it performs the
dual duty of keeping out people trying to get in from the Salish and
preventing any visitors from leaving Portland into the rest of Tir Tairngire.
The I-5 continues to the south and the imposing Multnomah Gate is to the
north, allowing access into the Salish lands.
