   You feel a touch of curious excitement as you browse through each aisle.
Some feature selections you've long imagined, and others you never thought
existed. The clerks that attend to the store seem to keep things professional,
but they also manage to bring out intimate and careful insights to help you
choose for your tastes.
   There are spacious fitting rooms available to help you visualize your
choices. Wether here to "browse" or shop, most people leave the store with a
smile. Welcome to Victoria's Secret.

Name:	Lingerie Department
Desc:$
   This section is the store's pride and joy. Mannequins barely covered by
satin, lace, and gauze line the walls - some of the garments would make a
twentieth century Playboy model blush. A beautiful young woman finishes up
with another customer, then turns to you and smiles.

Desc:$
   You enter the Changing booth and hear soft gentle music, barely audiable.
You are surrounded by full length mirrors, including the one on the door,
which may want to make sure is securley latched. You feel a cool breeze from
under the door, as you notice the shelving and hangers used to assist you.

   A slow, seductive song plays over the overhead speaker as you enter the
booth. Your reflection is displayed on the full length mirrors as a cool
breeze brushes over your legs, giving you goosebumps. It must be the
environment.

Name:	Confections Department
Desc:$
   This department features racks of tops and skirts. They call it the
confections department because the clothing here is sweet and pure, unlike the
slightly more risque wears offered in the rest of the store. An older lady
watches both browsers and customers with a smile on her face.

   This small room seems to be tucked away above the stairwell leading into
the crime mall. You can hear the muted voices of customers that are either
leaving or entering the crime mall from down belown. The young lady here
