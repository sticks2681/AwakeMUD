Name:	At Front Street and Mukilteo Speedway
Desc:$
   Just a stone throw away from the edge of Puget Sound is Front Street (Hence
its namesake), bordering its waters and allowing for both foot traffic and
vehicles to make their way along its shores. Puget Sound itself stretches out
almost endlessly to both the west and north from here, while off to the south
Mukilteo Speedway travels deeper down into the territory of Everett. Off to
the west one can make out a sizable park, its shades of green standing out
against the background of the Sound.

Name:	Along Mukilteo Speedway, crossing the tracks
Desc:$
   At this point along the Mukilteo Speedway, an old railroad track that sees
little public use, cuts across the road, announcing itself with multiple
crossing signs to alert travelers along it of incoming traffic. The road
begins to curve off in a subtle manner towards the southwest, heading off
through a small collection buildings, most likely for industrial use, before
it straightens once again to continue its journey south.

Desc:$
   As one continues their journey along the speedway, they're offered a view
of older buildings that have seen their share of the elements, and still
remain standing for the most part. Most of the buildings are still occupied,
and are kept in relatively good shape, instead of the usual husks or remnants
scattered through out the barrens. Puget Sound, and ever present landscape of
water and waves, can be seen off to the west as the speedway continues in a
north/south direction, parallel to its shore.

Desc:$
   Traveling down along the west side of Front Street is like traveling into a
different world, one of lush green and earthen hues coupled with a background
of blue from the Sound. Mukilteo State Park certainly does its best to
showcase the 'sleepy town' image that Everett has held for years, which is
certainly the case during the daylight hours, granted there are rumours abound
of the cities less desirable citizens (or non-citizens, rather) that come out
at night and make this area their haven.

   This rather lonely stretch of speedway features little in the way of
man-made structures, and instead off to the west the expansive collection of
water known as Puget Sound stretches off almost to the horizon, an occasional
ship passing by adding itself to the almost portrait like nature of the view
offered here. The Mukilteo Speedway itself continues its journey along towards
the southeast into what looks to be a more familiar surrounding to those born
into the plasticrete jungles of the city.

   Buildings begin to become more and more prevalent as the serene view of
Puget Sound becomes cluttered and blocked from view, an occasional peek

branch off from the main speedway, which curl and slither their way into the
collection of buildings that dot the landscape here, most passing through and
linking both commercial and residential buildings alike with one another.

a popular location for both locals and tourists eager to sample a selection of
seafood from the Puget Sound in the background.

industrial storage facilities, lacking the foot traffic common in the more
residential areas.

name, which is known as Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport. Massive
chainlink fencing borders the eastern edge of the road, keeping any would-be
tresspassers, thanks to some help from tangles of razorwire atop of it, from
climbing over and causing any trouble.

letterings that are in dire need of cleaning note their existence. A small
building, aptly named as 'The Lore Store', stands in the foreground of this
selection, its namesake easily getting across their particular niche in the

residence in the partially man-made scenery of the park. Mukilteo Speedway,
once again, continues its journey along in a southeastern direction, meeting

only for a small moment. To the east, however, is an almost about-face travel
into the cement and tar covered hearts of men, the Paine Field-Snohomish
County Airport an winding mass of plasticrete and aluminum structures,
emitting dull roars of machinery as they bend to their masters will. The
speedway continues along down further into Everett, headed away from the
airport and its mechanical musings.

distorted by the lines of hangars and building on the other side of the fence,
their rumblings eventually pouring out onto the roadway, which is mostly
drowned out by the sound of constant vehicle traffic. Mukilteo Speedway looms

splits off to the west, heading into what looks like a collection of sparse
residential housing, but is mostly filled by commercial offices for various
businesses that call Everett home, namely lower end companies that can't
afford the price tags on those fancy highrises and skyscrapers deeper into the
heart of the city to the southeast.

almost spacious feeling to the normally confined view, which also expands out
towards the southwest as the commercial offices begin appearing more friendly
to those who wish to spend a little cash during their journey along the
speedway. Chennault Beach Road breaks off from the main road and heads into a
patch of the more appealing configuration of money sinks, which houses several
bars and other dives.

Name:	Mukilteo Speedway, near Harbour Pointe Boulevard (SW)
Desc:$
   A terraced wall of concrete now borders the eastern edge of Mukilteo
Speedway, atop of which, stretching even higher, is that familiar scenery of
razorwire and chainlink of Paine Field, announcing itself as if it desperately
needed the attention. Traffic from Harbour Pointe Boulevard (SW) pours in and
merges onto the speedway, adding to its congestion as it continues its travel
northwest and southeast from here, the foot traffic having dropped off in lieu
of its vehicular counterpart.

Desc:$
   Finally, the speedway has broken free from its bond of chainlink fencing at
this point, and is now lined by fairly sparse sets of buildings, most of which
have given way to allow for a feature rarely seen elsewhere in other cities.
To the west is Picnic Point, a clearing consisting of mostly trees dotting its
landscape, where locals and tourists alike can soak up the scenery and enjoy
the day (or night) in relative peace, aside from the occasional roar overhead
of a passing aircraft. Directly to the southeast the speedway approaches
Beverly Park Road, which allows access into the more commercialized areas of
Everett.

   Mukilteo Speedway intersects with Beverly Park Road here, to the west is
Picnic Point, while off to the south a ways is the area known as which Lake
Serene, surrounding, what else, Lake Serene. The name itself may sound
appealing, but it mostly consists of lower end residential housing and mobile
home parks, certainly a step up above the barrens, but it certainly doesn't
speak volumes of wealth or decadence. Beverly Park Road itself spans off to
the southwest and northeast, its northernly path heading off up into a
commercial section of the city.

   Both sides of the road here consist of landscape littered with corporate

of keeping their businesses away from the faster paced scenery of uptown
Everett. Traffic begins to grow as travelers make their way into and out of
the main thoroughfare for Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport, which begins
to loom back into the background off in the distance to the north.

visible along this portion of roadway, its familiar razorwire topped chainlink
fence apparently having found itself a few residents in the form of several
types of avians, who are nesting contently in its protective features.
Traveling off to the south would bring one to the Mukilteo Speedway, a major
traffic flow for the city, while Beverly Park Road continues its journey
northeastward 112th Street (SW) and Airport Road.

   Rows of lower end apartments decorate the side streets along the western
edge of the road here, which are much nicer than one would expect. Due to
their close proximity to Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport, the rent tends
to be a little cheaper, for obvious reasons. The landscape is tastefully
filled in with healthy looking trees and other greenery, adding a touch of
class to an otherwise sparsely commercialized zone, lacking the usual store
fronts and businesses that make their home in the city.

Desc:$
   This intersection is at one of the main entrances to the Paine
Field-Snohomish County Airport, and as such is well defended by various design
implications, such as the lack of high rise buildings along its borders, whose
landscape consists of the occasional set of office buildings. Instead, patches
of native trees and small parks are doubled as natural defenses, making it
considerably harder to approach the airport by other means than the main
roadways into it, no to mention corporations, both small and large, are kept
at an arms length, with the exception of Fed-Boeing, just in case.

   Upon each end of the intersection, lining the roads themselves and

mostly native trees, growing thick and healthy. They practically dominate the
landscape, blocking the views of the more modern structures within the city
limits, aside from a handful of the largest in the distance. To only portion
of the roadway that is not swamped with such scenery is the southwestern end,
which is only dotted with a handful of small office buildings, tucked into and
sheltered by their green surroundings.

rustic wooden and metal restaraunt sign hanging off the nearest building to

Name:	Along Route 526 - (Boeing Freeway)
Desc:$
   Heading along the curve of Route 526 continues to offer a great view of the
airport south of here, and it isn't until one reaches this point that another
set of scenery begins rolling into sight. The Federated Boeing Facility,
considered by some as a local eye sore, looms into view to the northeast along
the freeway that was named after it. Love it, or hate it, some citizens of
Everett owe their livelihoods to the corporation, so they're more than willing
to put up with massive expanse of aluminum and concrete structures that
dominate a large plot of the landscape.

Desc:$
   The Route 526 overpass begins elevating itself above the ground as it winds
its way along the northern edge of Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport. The
view offered here is perfect for anyone who wishes to watch the daily routine
of aircraft inbound and outbound on their travels. Sturdy concrete reinforced
walls keep any accidents from spilling off onto the areas beneath, as traffic
pours across its length at a steady rate.

Desc:$
   The close proximity of The Federated Boeing Facility along the northern
edge of Route 526 makes it an especially good place to keep an eye on, and its
rather obvious that the security there is doing just that. Dotting the
landscape along side the freeway are both automated guard towers, most of
which apparently have the decency to disguise themselves as structural
supports for their outer perimeter wall and fence, along with multiple
able-bodied security teams, remainig constantly vigilant as they make sure
nobody is stupid enough to leap off the freeway overpass and make a run for
their walls.

Desc:$
   This section of the freeway is congested a bit moreso than other stretches
of the road, mostly due to the intersection of 20th Avenue (W), which allows
traffic into and out of the main gateway entrance of the Federated Boeing
Facility off to the northwest. The freeway itself continues along to the east,
and curves off a little to the southwest as it journeys along to the west.
Security seems to be quite tight, doing little to blend into the scenery at
this particular section of roadway, making sure only authorized vehicles and
those belonging to employees are taking a northern turn towards the facility.

change of pace from the usual mixture of dull greys and reflections cast by
windows made of high tempered glass. Ofcourse, the view doesn't last for long,
and once again shifts back to these monotonous hues once one travelers a
little further along to the west or east.

SIN-less or sinful, these businesses only care about one thing, and thats if
you've got the cash to blow on anything they offer. If one does, then they'll
welcome you with open arms, as long as you're not stupid enough to flash the
wrong gang colours or come equipped with clashing titles of the various crowds
that mingle.

   Commercial businesses of all shapes and sizes are scattered throughout the
web of office buildings and side streets, along with a few warehouses used for
the larger corporations that call the Intercity area home. There are hardly
any vacant or run-down buildings, aside from maybe one or two that have
sustained some sort of damage, wether accidental or intentional, and are being
renovated for their new owners. Evergreen Way churns traffic along at a steady
pace here, trying its best to manage the crowded lanes into a constant motion
of pedestrians and vehicles.

   The heart of the Intercity area is plagued by the usual culprits of
traffic, smog, the occasional bout of street violence, but all in all is
fairly tame in comparison to other places in the metroplex. One might see a
gang member or two, but for the most part they aren't flying their colours as
boldly or as freely as one might expect, probably due to the high
concentration of public security officers that patrol the area, trying to keep
it as clean as possible to uphold the stereotype of Everett being a sleepy
town without all the problems of other big cities.

   The Intercity area does its best to display the various businesses and
store fronts that make up its commercial sector, while also managing to curb
the usual territory disputes that erupt when SIN-less perps are given an inch
of freedom. What little graffiti that has been tagged onto the buildings or
property along the road side have been swiftly painted over to mask their
presence. To the southwest a ways, Evergreen Way meets up with Everett Mall
Way (SW), one of the main arteries that usher traffic to and fro to Everett
Beacon Mall.

whole 'green' atmosphere seen in other places nearby has taken a back seat to
good old fashioned capitalism. The Commercial sector begins picking up the
slack, posting signs of various shades of colour, all intended to catch the
eye of passerbys, attempting to draw in business from them, wether they be
locals or tourists. Evergreen Way continues its journey off to the northwest,
while Airport Road travels up towards the northwest.

   Offices spaces and other low rise buildings continue to make their presence
known from inbetween shades of green and brown, their aluminum siding and
concrete bases standing out quite a deal in comparison, but not enough to
unnecessarily clash with the enviroment. For the most part, the nuisance of
industrialization is ignored in these parts, as long as businesses do their
part to keep it from getting out to where anyone else can see it, so in most
cases the structures here are owned by small private corporations in need for
lab space, or a good spot to keep their records from the prying eyes of their
competition.

sectors that has seen a spurt of growth due to Everett's ever expanding

   The southern edge of Fairmont is considerably more green than most areas
within the city, which tries to find a balance between a growing industrial
sector while still trying to make room for a bit of nature in the process. The
mixture of concrete and ranging shades of green and brown makes for a cozy
change from most other areas, giving it an appeal that simply can't be found
in the rotting husks of places such as the barrens, which seem like some far
off land in comparison.

   Low rise office buildings are tastefully tucked behind and blended into the
scenery of lush, healthy greens, masking their dull grey structures to lend
this stretch of road a more natural look to it. Wildlife, one thing that is
hardly even present in most parts of the cities these days, can actually be
seen every now and then as they make their homes in the offered swathes of
nature. Even in this setting, however, the shadows stretch their tendrils
forth, making their presence known even in this kind of territory, as
buildings catering to the less respectable clients of the underworld make
themselves known.

Name:	Along 121st Street (SW)
Desc:$
   Nestled between Mukilteo Speedway to the west and Beverly Park Road to the
east, this little stretch of road features the usual road side nuyen traps,
consisting mostly of Stuffer Shacks and many of the other competitors
attempting to fill the same niche. A gas station or two is settled between
these businesses, helping travelers fill up for their eventual venture deeper
into the city, or out of it.

   Meandering its way between Boeing Freeway to the north, and Kasch Memorial
Park to the south, the western end of Casino Road offers a stark contrast of
scenery between the two as it travels its way to the east. Only a handful of
office buildings can be found here, all of which are tastefully set into the
landscape to in lieu of a more natural feel to the area.

Desc:$
   Casino Road (W) continues to hug along near the underbelly of Route 526,
almost constantly in the shadow of the menacing structure. Off to the south,
Walter E. Hall golf course, one of the few in the area, consists of well
tended tree lines, constantly trimmed grass and hedges, and an occasional sand
trap or two of varying tan shades. It stands as a dedication, to what can be
accomplished when concern for the land is put before the care of the lower
dregs of citizenry, as precious resources such as water are put to 'better'
use.

Desc:$
   The clashing of the big city atmosphere and the landscape of green is ever
present along this particular stretch of road, with Casino Corner and its
multiple vices just to the east, while to the west memorial parks and golf
courses seem to be more on par (Cue pained groan as that pun sinks in). At
some points, the two simply overlap one another, making for quite a bit of
scenery. But, for the most part, public security forces manage to keep them at
bay from one another, just in case things get out of hand.

Desc:$
   Center Road acts as an access route to various office buildings, the
largest in particular belonging to Bicson Biomedical to the north, who
apparently prefer their business to be private. The area is surrounded mostly
with large, healthy trees, making it hard to get a good look at until one is
almost upon their front step. Security here is sparse, with little in the way
of apparent features, such as bulky guards and security vehicles. Instead,
arrays of sensors and other such implements, along with cameras of all sizes
and substance are posted often along this length of road.

   A lengthy expanse of parking spaces has paved itself into the scenery,
which houses most, if not all of the vehicles used by employees at Bicson
Biomedical, which sits just a short way off to the east of the lot itself. The
view from this point of the building is, by any means, unimpressive, as it
looks like any other corporate owned office building might. Little aesthetic
design has been implemented in its construction, and for all intents and
purposes, was built to serve its purpose, and nothing else.

   Sitting beyond the bed and breakfast buildings is a carefully compiled row
of large rocks used as a break water for rougher weather, keeping the
buildings safe from wave activity and preserving their manicured lawns from
sand. The shore itself stretches a few dozen meters out, depending on the
tide, creating a large strip of beach front. Some tourists have set up lawn
chairs and even blankets to take the scenery in from, and considering how free
of trash and other refuse the area is, it's safe to say the park officials
take pride in it and go to quite an extent to keep it this way.

Name:	Along the Puget Sound shore front
Desc:$
   Several foot paths diverge and wind their way along the stretch of shore
front, which consists of sand and the occasional large chunks of rock sticking
up from it. The beach itself travels along in a northeast by southwest
fashion, traveling along the waters of Puget Sound. A few docks of varying
lengths jut off into the waves, which are often used for casual fishermen,
tourists and other visitors here to relax.

Name:	Out on a small dock
Desc:$
   Cool breezes blow in from Puget Sound, this small dock jutting out into its
waters twenty or so meters, making it perfect for both sight seeing or a
little fishing, which some of the visitors have taken to. Large cargo ships
and other miscellaneous vessels can be seen out on the Sound, heading to and
from the Everett docks, since the waters are a fairly busy shipping lane.

Desc:$
   A scenery of slightly off-white sand peppered with grey rocky formations
occasionally jutting up from its depths sits upon the shore of Puget Sound,
sparsely dotted with scrub brush and other grasses that dwell in this
enviroment. Along the shore here is another dock, looming out into the waters
along side another, while beaten foot paths stretch their way along the beach
front in both directions.

pushes maybe twenty or so meters out before coming to an end. An occasional
group of fishermen can be seen casting out from here, while others are taking
up the offer of a small line of viewing binoculars, bolted directly to the
dock, protected from the elements with casings of plastic.

collection of dunes appear as ripples in the scenery.

narrowing shoreline is the property of both public and private owners.

this shack isn't so bad, if you can stand the smell of large quantities of

Name:	The main dining area
Desc:$
   The main dining area is spacious, consisting of neaty arranged tables and
chairs, all of which are cleaned and polished to a shine. The area is brightly
lit to show off the modern architecture, but soft enough on the eyes for
comfort sake, making for a relaxing and casual atmosphere. Waiters slink
gracefully between tables, taking or delivering orders, or just checking to
see if customers are satisfied with their meals.

Desc:$
   The Gravity Bar North, living up to its name, features a full length bar
for patrons who would rather kick back and relax while they enjoy a drink. The
walls here are used to showcase several different fish tanks, some salt water
with tropical species swimming around, while others are freshwater, ranging in
both size and shape to add to the decor of the place.

Desc:$
   This eating area is designed for those who would prefer a bit more privacy
as they dine, or perhaps for business sake, since the corporate types are
considered locals here. Several fish tanks are built into the architecture,
showcasing their contents to diners, most of which have been carefully placed
for maximum aesthetic affect.

towards the west, the walls themselves are constructed of thick, but still
quite transparent safety glass, helping to show off the view of the shore

   The entire wall is crafted from a thick and durable safety glass, which act
as massive panoramic windows to offer an almost unrestricted view of the
western shore of Everett. Even at this low of a height, the lack of taller
buildings and the placement make it great for viewing Puget Sound in all of
its glory. Multiple sets of smaller rectangular tables and chairs are lined
along both walls, leading back further into the dining area south of here.

generators and other mechanisms are built into the scenery itself, along with
fold-up trideo screens and telecoms with satellite uplinks for business

attempting to get inside, ranging from low-level corporate scum, wage slaves,
shadow wannabes, posers and all of the other various plebes looking for a
taste of the night life. Some of the rougher locals of the shadows seem to be
getting in quicker and with little complaint, while others are ushered back
into line to wait their turn. Word on the streets is the yaks have their hands
in this establishment.

   The smell of booze, cigar smoke, sweat and maybe even a hint of tears and
blood bombards the senses, mingled with the various perfumes and colognes that
habituates are sporting. The area opens up into different sections,
partitioned from one another in various manners, consisting of thin rice paper
designed screens, potted plants and other tricks of the trade to give
occupants the feeling of privacy from the other sections. Despite this
arrangement, all of the areas can clearly see the main stages at the center of
the club, offering perfect views of who or whatever is performing that night.

Name:	In a private booth
Desc:$
   This private booth is sealed off from the main club by way of an almost
soundproof door, which muffles the action outside to little more than a low
murmur of background noise. Shaded lamps and kanji lined edging decorate the
room, inbetween the traditional Japanese art adorning the walls. Several small
potted plants add a bit of life to the scenery, one of which no doubt houses a
concealed white noise generator for those private business talks, without
sacraficing the aesthetics of design. An RJ-715 datapoint is built into the
scenery as well, decorated as a traditional, stylized Japanese lion, its mouth
opening wide to provide matrix access.

Name:	The northwestern end of the nightclub
Desc:$
   Lines of booths and smaller tables with comfortable padded chairs
surrounding them are scattered along this section of the club, offering plenty
of seating for patrons as they enjoy the shows offered on the stages nearby.
The air is hazy with cigar and cigarette smoke (and maybe a little something
else), which becomes more prominent as the various neon lighting bores through
it and spills down onto the habituates gathered here. An unmolested view of
the stages is offered here, while off to the bordering edge of the club there
are several private booths for those who wish to escape the hustle and bustle
of the nightclub.

   The main stage actually consists of one large, wide central raised platform
for performers, with multiple catwalk like extentions that branch off into
smaller platforms, allowing for a wide range of performances to take place at
once. The artists slated at The Rubber Suit come in all shapes and forms,
between live local bands, female dancers, or a mixture of the two for added
flavour, though a majority seem to hint at Japanese tastes.

   Paths converge in this area, snaking their way through the smaller stages
and other sections of the club. On the northern end a set of wide, low stepped
stairs make their way up to the bar area, which is located on a raised
platform that overlooks the main area of the nightclub, making it a great
place to take in the scenery and performers as they do their thing on both the
main stage and its smaller counterparts.

   Adorned in the ever present traditional Japanese design, with a hint of
modern influence, this private area is reserved for the owner of The Rubber
Suit and his personal clientele and business partners. Armed Japanese
bodyguards flank the area as it leads to a door in the back, its shoji screen
design marked clearly with "Off-Limits" in both English and Japanese, just so
there aren't any mistakes to be made. Invitation only is the word of the day.

stretching along like an ocean, its waves only occasionally disrupted by
fleshy masses of shoppers looking for the best deals in town. Approaching

for those who either don't feel like walking (who does?), or just want to keep
their vehicle clean and cozy in its confines during their stay at the mall.

clearance is offered for vehicles making their way around inside of the garage
itself, along with imbedded gridguide systems so visitors don't even need to
park themselves. The garage itself continues along for quite some distance,
containing plenty of parking spots for even the most massive flood of

the garage, some of which have their arms full of bags and attempting to make

of elevators to reach the upper floors of the mall.

show up anywhere that has the steady exchange of nuyen and material goods.
Along with the technological watchdogs, quite a few security guards seem to
have their rounds overlap in this area, just in case.

Name:	An underground garage, near the stairs
Desc:$
   The flow of shoppers isn't quite as heavy in this portion of the garage,
most likely due to the fact that unlike the spacious elevators offered on the
opposite side, the only way up to the shopping levels are a set of good old
fashioned stairs. They see comparably less traffic, mostly due to the fact
that people are lazy, and what's the point of being a fat consumer if you
actually have to walk up stairs? What little traffic this area sees are due to
security patrols whose job it is to wander up and down along them, along with
the occasional chump who is too impatient to wait for an open spot on the
elevators.

   The scent of something delicious wafts through the staircase corridor,
bringing with it all of the temptations the food court on the ground floor has
to offer mall goers. The hustle and bustle begins to become louder as the
entrance of the ground floor opens up, but the small trickle of foot traffic
along the stairs is still minimal. Off to the east there is an alcove set up
for ATM transactions, offering customers a place of privacy to pull out their
life savings and blow it on things they don't really need.

side of the building, a few brave 'fitness nuts' still try their luck at the
old fashioned way to get between floors.

Name:	At the top of the first floor stairs
Desc:$
   Ascending the stairs leads to the first floor (Who'da thunk it?), and guess
what, the foot traffic is still thin. Lazy mall goers at their finest. The
corridor cuts back and heads towards the main entrance to the first floor,
while from here, a security sign can be seen pointing to the rent-a-cops
office. Feeling adventurous? Then keep on walking!

   The entrance to the shopping sector on the first floor widens here, even
though it is pretty pointless consider the lack luster attendance on the
stairs. A backlit sign is bolted to the ceiling, its black lettering over a
dull red light making it easy to spot, its arrow pointing off eastward to the
office set up there.

   Droves of customers and other patrons trudge along in a non-stop, steady
stream of clicking boots and the scuffing and squeaking of shoes. Over towards
the western edge of the large, open room, is an ice cream shop of some sorts,
who are doling out delicious treats to the masses. Off to the south, in a bit
of irony, is a spacious furniture shop, who probably isn't very keen on having
any of the customers of the previous store strolling in and getting their
sticky mitts all over the merchandise.

   The crowd thins slightly before once again pressing together in a large mob
of limbs and the occasional horn or two. Various ash trays and other pieces of

which consist of giant potted plants, some of which are hard to tell if
they're actually real or not. Off to the south is a busy sporting goods store,
while off further north are the stairs heading up to the shopping floor above,
as well as the parking garage down below.

most of which are accompanied by a large plant of some type for atmosphere. A
large central display has been set up here, which apparently shows the
location of shoppers, along with information and directions to the shops that
are spread out in all directions from it. Off to the west a way, the elevators
can be seen, while to the east, wide sets of stairs accomplish the same task,
albeit with a bit more physical exertion. Can you tell which route gets more
use? Thought so.

The smell of the food court nearby is sure to make anyones mouth water when

of bodies, weaving themselves between and around one another as they go about
their business.

partially drowned out by the occasional off tune note drifting out of the
instrument shop to the north, which seems to have a wide range of musician
tools.

shops are set up along the outer rim of the spacious main first floor, where
lines of foot traffic weave and mill their way amongst one another.

help soak up the scent of all the bleach used in the water. The air venting
system does its best to keep up with all of the cleaning supplies, but the
lemon scented disinfectant used to cover up the smell of bleach does little
else but mingle and mix into the scent of a sterile hospital room. At the
least, it's much better than having to smell the rest of the mall goers that
mill their way through the upper floor.

Name:	Near the stairs on the first floor
Desc:$
   The loud, rough and tumble mall atmosphere can easily bombard the senses,
its mass of noisey mall goers echoing throughout the room as it opens up and
away from the stairs east of here. The smell up here on the first floor is a
bit more sterile, as no edible goods are to be had up here. Unfortunately,
that smell is replaced by the tinge of bleach masked with lemon scented soap
from the floors, and a hint of polishing wax to boot.

   Lines of bodies shuffle along in an almost zombie like manner, waiting for
the mall goers infront of them to move a foot or two before closing the gap,
and repeating the entire maneuver like a well choreographed dance sequence.
More outlet shops are to be found along the outer edge of the spacious main
room, which is a bit of a misnomer, since it is anything but spacious with all
of these patrons packed in here.

Desc:$
   The crowd thins and thickens randomly as the masses of mall goers jockey
for position, most of them having no problem cutting infront of others in an
attempt to get at the goods offered in the nearby stores. Granted, such
tactics aren't even necessary, as the permanent fixtures have plenty of their
goods in stock, but leave it to society to look beyond such reasonable things,
and resort to passive aggressive behavior instead.

   This shop seems to be dedicated to the more technology driven aspects of
society, most of which is integrated into daily life by this time. Helpful
employees work their way from customer to customer, attempting to placate and
see to their every need, as long as it ends in a sale ofcourse. Several
personal computers and other do-it-yourself kits are featured for both
amateurs and those more inclined towards the higher end of the spectrum of
tech nerds.

   This room is quite sterile, and has an air of professionalism, aside from
the fact that it is an outlet store in a mall. They do, however, offer quality
optics and cybereyes, and their team of employees are very knowledgable about
their area of expertise. Multiple back rooms are set up for privacy, and
sanitation, since some of their surgeries can be slightly invasive. Completely
replacing someones eyes is very serious business, and they take their jobs
very seriously here at Eye Spy.

deals in some high quality bits and pieces of ware that aren't particularly
easy to get ones hands on. A professional atmosphere has taken over the shop,

humour, their selection of wares has been set up like a fast food restaurant,
letting patients mix and match their desires as it suits them. Several back
rooms are set up for privacy and recovery of patients having gone through some
of the more invasive of surgeries.

   This private little alcove offers shelter to those who wish to max out
their credsticks and go on shopping benders, all the while keeping their
personal information safe with fairly secure booths where transactions can be
done in privacy. Several cameras are trained on this area, all of which point
away from the machines, covering the entrance/exit, keeping an eye out for any
misfits who are looking to cause the rent-a-cops here trouble. There also
seems to be matrix landline phone booths set off to the side, if you don't
mind the fact they've been lightly defaced by sharpie pen graffiti.

   Haven to rent-a-cops everywhere, this office is a sweet deal, equipped with
necessities such as coffee pots, doughnuts and closed circuit trideo sets.
They keep a watchful eye on the camera feeds, whenever their favourite sports
team isn't on the portable trideo set parked on a nearby desk. Afterall,
beating down young mall punks doesn't exactly require the expertise of a SWAT
team, since a good spritz of pepperspray and a few lumps from a billyclub
usually get the job done just fine.

   This wide and powerful elevator has been beefed up to handle a dozen or

their requested floors in a swift manner. Cheesy music is being pumped out of
hidden speakers in the ceiling, which echoes off of the polished metal walls
and fills the area with outdated music that most folks wouldn't be caught dead
listening to. A panel along side of the door is clearly labeled, along with
braille notations upon their surfaces.
