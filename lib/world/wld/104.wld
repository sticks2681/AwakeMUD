   This is an ordinary, low level office, for a corporate nobody.  Papers are
stacked on a regular desk, and behind that a regular chair, leather, or good
imitation.  There is a trid, and a terminal on the desk.

   A plain office to say the most, there is a solitary picture on the wall of
a boquet of flowers.  Papers lie scattered over a barren desk, alongside a
broken trid.  A box is tipped over in the corner.

Name:	Below A Corporate Tower
Desc:$
   Towering above East Tacoma and most of its buildings is a magnificent
scraper of the sky.  This behemoth is marked by the words, "^rUnited Oil^n" at the
top, in luminescing red, for all to see. To the north, the revolving glass
doors welcome clients and employees into the nice, dry, heated lobby.

   Dripping wealth, this lobby shows just how much money can be made off of
dead dinosaurs.  Expensive designer furniture makes up the decor, matching
tasteful vintage artwork, and employees wearing suits that emptied the pocket
as much as a down payment on an average car.

   The sound of foot traffic fills the hall; the clatter of shoes and high
heels reverberate off the walls, and the sheer noise of the people is
deafening at times.  This is a busy floor to say the elast.  Phones ring
constantly and peace isn't to be found. West and East continues the hallway,
while to the North is the elevator lobby.

   Heating ducts along the floor of the hallway keep the temperature at a
tolerable 75 degrees, while adding fragrance to remove the smell of people.
The windows look out onto the street, where foot and vehicle traffic is
constant.  Though there is no outside noise able to be discerned, the racket
in here is largely made up of people, business, and the incessant ringing of
phones.

   Eastwardly an office containing a low level executive, people walk in and

Through the wall, the sound of the elevator can be heard whooshing, up and

the various people, drifting through the warm air, to the South and East,

new discoveries.  Lots of glass beakers, microscopes, and other scientific
items are spread around the room.

   The private passage between labs, this is more restricted, requiring
security clearance to roam freely. Scientists use this as their primary way
between the labs, instead of the crowded main hallway.  This prevents leaks on
top secret projects, and just overall ease for the workers.

deliriously thinking up innovative ways of using oil and its by products.

   Plants, typical, friendly house, or office, plants decorate this drab
corridor.  They make an atmosphere with a little more splendor, but it doesnt
have the all around feel of warmth.  This is an office building after all.
Cold and business like.

   Nothing special, this is just a well light passage way in a very top secret
floor.  Plastic testing done on this floor, and the one below it are so
classified, that the government is still wondering how its done.  Some of the
designed prototypes include super impact armor with anti-ballistic coatings,
lightweight super-grade plastics that are extremely resistant to sudden heat
and explosive impact for use in weapons.

   This banal hallway could use some freshening up.  It's bland color scheme
and boring tapestries on the windows over looking the streets of Seattle, and
beyond that the bay.  Atleast the floor is clean of scuff marks.

   A long stainless steel table is in the middle, with several gadgets of
sorts. Lots of different things are here, mainly for vehicles.  The oil
industry still fuels cars, thus the need for marketing parts.  If the car
becomes more efficent, it uses less gas, but if the company sells the parts
also, they lose no money.

   There is a cool gadget on display here.  It has a bulb of some sort, and
several bottles of liquid screwed into the back of it, each of varying color.
A sign says, "^rTurn the thyristor to the right, and the lemon, vinegar, potato,
cetane powered light will get brighter!^n"  Everything else is pretty drab in
here though.
