Name:	Sprawl Demon's Lair
Desc:$
    This small section of an abandoned building is clearly inhabited by
someone--  or something. Broken chunks of  concrete, glass, and other rubble
make the  footing  difficult, and the dim, flickering light casts  eerie
shadows  against the  walls. A squalid, blood-stained mattress lies against
one wall, partially concealed  by a pile of rubble that occasionally spits
sparks across the floor. The room smells  of blood, exotic incense, and dust.

    You're standing just inside the doorway of a long-derelict abandoned
building. The windows are all broken, and most of them boarded up. Even parts

Name:	Unstable Stairway
Desc:$
   You manage to clear the rubble out of your way and walk down the stairs.
Unfortunately, this portion of the building is unstable, and promptly
collapses around you, burying you under a pile of stone and steel.

Name:	Broken Steps of Peril
Desc:$
   As you start down these stairs you notice they are broken. Not just by time
and neglect, but by design. Someone (or something) is obviously not interested
in you making it in one piece down these steps. As short distance down and you
have to make an effort to keep your balance. One mistep...and who knows where
you'll land.

Name:	Emergency Stairs, Top Floor.
Desc:$
    The lights are out here, with very little trickling in from below. You see
that the normal light is missing, and the emergency light has been savagely
ripped from the wall. There's a door here labelled 'Employees Only'.

Name:	A Frighteningly Clean Room
Desc:$
   Compared to everything else in this Hellhole, the air in here  smells clean
and sweet. There's no rubble on the floor of any kind and the grime has been
scoured away somehow, leaving a clean and shiny appearance. Standing in the
middle of the room is a man in an expensive three-piece suit, wearing dark sun
glasses.

    You are standing in a clean, well-lit hotel room, with fresh bed-linens
and no trace of the gore and grime of the lower two floors. The pillows are in
velvet pillowcases and look like they've been recently fluffed.
