Name:	A Set of Stairs
Desc:$
   The bedrock here has been carved out into a set of stairs, each capped with
heavy iron. A heavy-duty hydraulic stair-lift lies inactive in an indent in
the floor and is attached to a pair of large metal rails running along the
walls. A set of bright bulbs, recessed into the walls provides a steady, white
light, illuminating the polished bedrock as it gives way to pale blue plaster
as it moves away from the stairs. A small glass hemisphere, heavily tinted, is
set into the ceiling just above the base of the stairs and betrays a small
security camera, its red LED pulsing ominously behind the reflections in the
glass.

bare wire, which lead from small holes in the plastered walls, across the
hallway and into a large room to one side. Away from a set of stairs at one
end, the corridor slopes sharply downward, toward a concrete garage.

Name:	A Large, Round Room
Desc:$
   A large, round room. The floor here is slightly lower then the floor of the
corridor outside and a series of ducts spaced evenly against the walls
provides a warm, steady temperature for the occupants. A large, round table
sits dead center of the room, with a white noise generator in its center and
dozens of tech magazines scattered haphazardly over its surface. Against one
wall is a trid unit, sitting against the curved wall as if designed for the
space, and against another is a thick red curtain, moving slightly in the
breeze from the ducts. Opposite the doorway to the corridor outside is another
hallway, its floor slightly lower then that of this room.

   This is the single largest room in the complex. There are several areas
spread around. The southwest corner is dominated by a massive conference table
that looks to be made of solid redwood. It is surrounded by thick, plush
leather executive type chairs. Set out a bit from the northeast corner is a
sitting area with various chairs and a large couch, all with coverings of
various lush materials. The other two corners are clear of obstructions and
the concrete flooring is exposed but for a small area near the southeast
corridor that is covered in padded mats, obviously for full contract workouts.

Name:	Sean and Candice's Bedroom
Desc:$
   This large bedroom has the obvious theme of the pre-awakening times. The
nightstand and dressers are made from a finely polished mahogany, one
nightstand having a beautifully designed silver heart imprinted on the top of
it. A large 45-inch, old-style television sits against the eastern wall, and
has special conversion cables in the back to make it compatible with modern
day plug-ins. An elegant king-sized bed sits a little away from the middle of
the western wall, shrouded in semi-transparent silken drapes. The sheets
themselves are made out of expensive, microfabricated Egyptian cotton with a
thread count in the thousands. Perhaps the most unique feature of this room is
a magically grown, sized-down weeping willow tree that comes directly out of
the hardwood floors and creates a comforting quasi-tent over the bed.

dresser, on top of it lies a pile of useless junk, some trideos, a trid

inch plasma screen, with speakers setup around the room for the great surround
sound experience.  Also connected through the speakers is a stereo, which is
on it's own seperare shelf next to the bed.  On the opposing side of the bed
is a table, on which is an alarm clock, a medium-sized wad of cash, and a few
hard cover books about magik and some weapons. There are mudvayne posters all
over the walls and a rack full of various cd's. In the right corner is a big
safe.

   A decent sized kitchen, it come with every a chef could want.  A large
stove, with a big oven, for those pesky family meals.  A supersized fridge,
for storing all the left overs, and that keg of beer.  The cupboards and
counters are not cheap, in anyway shape or form.  The cupboards, made of pine
tounge and groove board, have been stained, to a darker, shiny finish.  The
counter top is white granite, likely imported from New England.  There is a
large sink, with a few empty plates, but beneath it to the right is a
dishwasher, so no labor is needed.  Also, there is a coffee maker, a toaster,
a microwave, a blender, and a mixer.  All these things can be useful,
especially when munchies are involved, or smoothies.  Or those burritos that
are in the freezer.

   This room is dominated by massive racks for weapons and armor. These racks
are about half full with various arms and munitions of all sorts. There are
two short work tables in the center of the room. The left side table has a
complete gunsmithing set up laid out in neat order on it while the right side
table has equipment for repairing and maybe even creating armor.

   As you pass under the doorway to this room, you notice a sign nailed above
the doorway that says '^BPlacitum ex inculpatis^N, ^Rperditio ex malus^N.' This room
is sparsely decorated, except for a foot locker that sits in front of a
twin-size bed, with a desk littered with what looks like cyberdeck equipment
and parts. A bright lamp sits on one end of the desk, along with a magnifiying
glass and other tools for working on electronic equipment. You notice that on
top of the footlocker sits a small, leather-bound ^Ybook^N. You also see a
^Ydartboard^N on the wall opposite the desk, with what looks like a picture stuck
to the middle. A stereo sits on the floor near the desk, and next to that are
a stack of albums with names like "Smashing Pumpkins" and "Tool".

This book looks like it's seen a lot of use. The front of it reads "Sun Tzu on
The Art of War" and the inside reads "The art of war is of vital importance to
the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
neglected.", and "It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils
of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on."

Name:	Atop the Willow Tree
Desc:$
   From a magically induced stair case growing as part of the trunk itself,
the top of the weeping willow tree can be reached. Even more magic has been
worked here, creating a sturdy wooden circle growing from the top of it about
15 feet in diameter. It sits below a large, spotless window covering the
majority of the ceiling. A cord hangs from above, allowing a semi-transparent
set of blue drapes to be pulled over the window when needed. The wooden
platform is very smooth, though not slick, and actually has small blades of
grass sprouting from it that tickle your feet. The bed can be glimpsed
directly below, through the branches of the tree. Come clear nights, this
little spot makes for an absolutely breath-taking scene, and still looks
amazing even in daylight as seagulls fly against the sky.

nature mural which encompasses most of the room. A ashwood futon runs parallel
to the west wall, and three Go boards sit in a triangle against the east wall.
Each board appears to be a different game in progress. A small music box rests
next to one of the boards, and seems to be loaded with various jazz music
discs. A single wooden chest rests against the southern wall.

reek that bad of liquor and beer. There is a door to the east with "Garage"

Obsidian, glasslike.

   This private booth has plenty of room to sit about 8 overweight Giants, and
enough standing room beside it from the door for a few more. The table is of
solid black obsidian, with a few dinks and scratches, and the occasional stab
hole in it. On the back wall is a large-old style white noise generator, even
though it is old, it still gets the job done. Directly above the table, about
3 meters hide is an empty dark looking small room, with a red light flashing.
When you look closer, you see that a moveable mini-machine gun has been rigged
up to stop anyone from walking in when they shouldn't. The only other
comparable booth as nice as this has to be at Dante's Inferno.

There is a parking lot big enough to hold a few Bulldogs, and a few specially

and rigging being done. One vehicle has a black tarp pulled over, but you can
still  make out the mounts and what looks like Assault or Panther cannons
mounted on either side, but you're not sure. There is a pair of bumpers lying
on the  ground near a door and a slightly damaged pole, showing that even in
here there are accidents.

   This is where some upper-class business men come to some fine riggers add
an action layer of armor or have accidents repaired. Sparks are flying and
heavy  metal-punk-industrial-something is playing out of a surround sound
system. Motor oil is prevalent around, and boxes and crates of parts are here
and there.  You don't see anything to illegal, save for maybe a mount with
nothing here and there. As you look around, one thing catches your eye the
most. There is a  giant Drone with dual 50-Shell holding shotguns and 2 Large
Machine guns on its shoulders, but it doesn't look active, thankfully.

sitting by himself drinking and snorting some, not causing any known trouble.
A few mixing machines are on the other side of the pub, and kegs are lined up
behind the sturdy pub-wall table. You see a bullet hole that suddenly stops
from a shiny amount of metal, which you estimate has to be at least a foot
thick.

scanning the room, but doesn't zoom on you in particular. On the ceiling, made
out of  a blood-colored paint is the phrase "HATE IS MINE" A fire-extinguisher

wall.

you  understand that this must be some well-kept and organized group. There is
a poster board on a wall with a few notes tacked on, but nothing worth

Name:	The lounge
Desc:$
   This looks like an executive lounge and a gang-banger ball combined. Long
sofa's and pull-out leather beds are around on the western side as well as an
occasional computer and table. On the eastern side are scruffy looking chairs
and turned over table or two. Some of the more trashy looking figures are on
the east side, including an ork and troll or two. It has the look of the Big
Rhino and the Gentlemen loser. On the southern end is a small area with a few
beds and a medical unit set up for any treatment.

Desc:$
   A few flashes blind you, and this looks like a high-technology area of this
passage. You see cameras and boxes and crates and all sorts of things. There
is a big metal loop in the ceiling with a grappling hook on it, and a pocket
secretary and shadowland terminal in the wall. The sleek walls make this look
like it was made in the year 2100 instead of 2060. There is an entrance to the
west with computer screens and to the south is the ever present bang of a gun.

Desc:$
   Flashing monitors and computers screens show view from a number of cameras
and readouts of the ultrasound sensors stationed around. There is a few matrix
links on the walls, and deckers accessing information and downloading it into
huge stores of database on the walls and center of the room. The slim but dull
lights help the monitors display better to the eyes. A few monitors are in
heat displayed, allowing Trolls and dwarves to use them and see just as good
as anyone else. There is an exit with a few shot sounds to the west and some
small talking in the east.

Desc:$
   You enter into a dark shady hallway with a cool mist spraying from the
vents in the ceiling. The walls are made out of steel and every time you seem
to take a step it makes a screeching sound which is good incase of intruders.
There is a blood looking liquid in the north east corner with what looks like
to be rats drinking out of it. The hallway continues from west to east with
double doors to the north.

Name:	Wumpscut's private room
Desc:$
   The room of ^RWumpscut. Wumpscut^n's abode has heads in jars on a few tables,
as well as a massive painting of Death, A cloaked Skeleton with red eyes and a
giant scythe, staring and pointing at you. On the floor is garbled messages
ranging from "In guns we trust" to "HATE IS MINE" and more. Axes and swords
and blood covered cloth is still around. Gruesome and horrible. You see a leg
in one container with the word DANTE'S wrote on it, it seems to have been
chewed off by something. A shirt is on a hanger that has the word HATE on it,
nothing more, in white letters standing out on its blackness. A daemonic
statue is in the very center of the room, Large as a troll and more muscular,
it has a sword that looks like red steel with a magical flame light and
burning. It has yellow beady eyes and if it wasn't for the pastorate texture,
you would swear it is real. A picture of a little Chinese man is on the west
wall with the words "BRUCE LEE" on it. Another beside it is of a white cube,
the exact picture that a decker would see in the matrix, and has the word
"Nueromancer" wrote under it. With all this hatred and evil pouring out of the
room, the cross painted on the ceiling that looks like a sword seems to do
little to out due it. On the desk is a bible, that looks well-read, and an
open suitcase with nothing in it. You hear something walking around you, and
decide it is not wise to stay to long. The flash of a blade flickers around
you, maybe real, maybe some intense hologram.

look on the western wall and see a man hung from the next with a shotgun blast
to the chest and both his legs gone, and a tattoo saying "HATE IS STUPID"
Violence seems to be an answer if talking and haggling doesn't work.

A swinging Scythe is in constant motion with a holographic phrase of DEATH
DEALERS appearing as the blade swings back and forth. Now if you could only
figure out how the hell it is swinging.
