Sea-Tac is a sleek and well-designed airport boasting every modern
convenience. No expense was spared for air filtration systems to
guarantee an atmosphere free of toxins. Security is high. Luggage
handling is performed entirely by computers with the resources of
the Matrix to draw upon, minimizing error. In short, little more
could be asked of the busiest airport in North America.
