Name:	An area of dense jungle
Desc:$
   As you continue further into the jungle it becomes harder and harder to
move, thick foliage blocks you in from all sides except a small clearing
through the undergrowth to the north. Strangely, no animals are visible yet
their calls can clearly be heard.

Name:	A clearing in the jungle
Desc:$
   A break in the canopy allows light to stream down into this clearing,
although a lack of foliage seems to suggest it is not a natural occurence.
Extremely dense undergrowth and large trees prevent any further progress, even
knives fail to clear a path. To the south is a small hole in the scrub leading
back towards civilisation.

Name:	A small room inside a hollowed out tree.
Desc:$
   Someone appears to have hollowed this room out of the tree while it was
still living, even now a strange glow from the walls suggests a possible
magical influence keeping the tree intact. There is no furniture save a single
chair sitting in the middle of the room, although a wooden rail does seem to
twist up into the heights of the tree.

Desc:$
   You are half way up the rusted ladder onto the rig, every move you make
emits alarming creaking noises from the ancient metalwork. Above you in the
distance the top of the ladder is visible, although reaching it may be hard
due to several missing rungs on the ladder. Now far below, the ocean crashes
against the massive supports of the oil rig, constantly shaking the entire
structure. With any luck a boat will be down there, waiting to take you back
to shore.

Desc:$
   The only visible way down from the rig is here, which is disturbing
considering its current state. To the north is a large set of metal doors,
secured with padlocks and chains. Looking around it would appear to be the
main entrance to the superstructure that housed the crew and more delicate
equipment many years past. While the chains and door are as rusted as the rest
of the facility, the padlock is comparatively modern and has a small
electronic keypad which gives off a faint glow through the fog. To the east
and west an intermittantly railed walkway extends around the edge of the
structure, dotted with holes and abandoned equipment.

   Now just inside the structure, darkness seems to reach out and surround you
like the thick fog outside. Enough light struggles through the doorway for
those with good vision to see, but further inside is pitch blackness. The
floor is strewn with flakes of rust and paint that have peeled from the walls,
and your footsteps raise small clouds of dust as you proceed. It seems as if
no-one has been here in a long time.

you struggle to keep your head above water, blackness sweeps in and you lose
consciousness.

crashing into the immense legs that anchor the rig to the sea bed, each impact
sending shudders through it.

#31653
Name:	Near the elevators
Desc:$
   This level stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the rig, the sturdy
construction and thick glossy white paint seems to have held the rust at bay.
To your east is the elevator, and to your west the corridor continues on to a
huge metal door, set into the wall. Unlike the first level, some kind of power
source must be functioning here as dim red lighting issues from small lamps
recessed into the ceiling.

Name:	Standing before the airlock
Desc:$
   A huge metal door is set flush into the wall to the west here, with only a
small panel of glass in the centre giving you a glimpse of what might be on
the other side. What looks to be a grade 4 SOTA maglock is mounted on the wall
to the side of the door, without any visible means of access. Red emergency
lighting provides dim illumination.

airlock you had to pass through to enter the facility.

Name:	A branch in the corridor
Desc:$
   The corridor splits off to the east and west here, as well as continuing
north to a heavy looking door. A small placard pinned to the wall reads:
"Laboratories - East, Clean Room - West." Seems pretty self explanatory. The
red emergency lighting continues here, giving the bright white walls a rather
macabre appearance. A faint humming noise seems to emanate from somewhere
nearby, but it's hard to pinpoint.

Desc:$
   To your north and south clean sterile labs open out off the corridor, which
leads west back to the central area of the facility. The red emergency
lighting is supplemented by a few dim fluorescent tubes, perhaps indicating
that a small amount of main power is online.

Name:	A cluttered laboratory
Desc:$
   Various textbooks and optiglass storage units litter the benches in this
lab, along with some pretty SOTA looking medical equipment. You may recognise
a few of the basic items such as a centrifuge, microscope and Bunsen burner,
but others are incomprehensible to all but the most medically knowledgeable.
Among other small biological specimens, the large vat in the corner of the
room seems to suggest some kind of genetic research. But into what?

Name:	A scorched laboratory
Desc:$
   A thin layer of soot coats the walls and ceiling of this presumably
once-white laboratory. Further evidence of the fire that must have engulfed
this place is seen everywhere: melted glass, charred scraps of paper and even
distorted scientific instruments. In the corner, a large filing cabinet has
been tipped over, all its drawers hanging open and emptied of whatever it once
held. It looks as if someone didn't want whatever this room kept secret to get
out.

Name:	A heavily reinforced door
Desc:$
   The door to your west is similar in design to the main entrance airlock,
although if anything it seems more heavily reinforced. Various biohazard,
radiation and other warning symbols are plastered liberally all over the area,
giving you the impression that it might be smart to wear some protective
clothing. Looking through the small glass panel set into the center of the
door you can make out some kind of laboratory, still illuminated by bright
'daylight' bulbs. Surgical instruments are laid out by a stainless steel
operating table, many you do not recognise.

   This room is brightly lit with blue tinted bulbs, giving the appearance of
natural light. A large stainless steel table in the centre of the room seems a

scattered around it. A large steel cabinet at the back of the room has been
left ajar, and you see a small glass vial lying on the floor beneath it,
broken.

   To your west is a solidly built, white enamelled door, slightly recessed
into the wall. At about human head height, if not slightly higher a small set
of metal bars have been installed into the door to allow a view of the
occupant. Looking further north you can see another identical door, and a
large door of a different design terminates the corridor. Further to the south
the corridor splits off east and west to different parts of the facility.

Desc:$
   The corridor comes to an abrupt end here, two solid looking doors to your
north and west preventing any further progress. The west door appears
identical to the one next to it slightly south of here, but the door to the
north is dented outwards, as if something inside had hit it with a
sledgehammer. No grill or panel offers a view inside, although you think you
might be able to hear a faint scratching as you put your head to the door.

Name:	A dark holding cell
Desc:$
   This cell is completely bare save for a small drain in the far corner, and
small slits in the ceiling which issue cold, salty air presumably from
outside. It seems to have been constructed with a specific creature in mind,
as the ceiling is over four metres from the ground, leaving plenty of room for
even the tallest of metahumans. Splashes of blood and claw marks adorn the
walls, and the inside of the metal door is heavily scratched and dented.
Whatever is kept in here obviously didn't like it.
