#31101
Name:	Little Chiba
Desc:$
   Steam rises from vents and open manholes, giving this street an
otherworldly feel. The buildings here are shorter and squatter; the signs and
advertisements hanging from them, a mixture of English and Japanese. A similar
shift's occured in pedestrian demographics: more Asians, more runner-types,
less corps...and no cops. The air's filled with the smells of food, gear,
nuyen -- and that indefinable, adrenaline-laced tang of danger. Little Chiba
continues to the south, and Fifth Street lies to the east. A small furniture
shop stands to the northwest.

Name:	Little Chiba 
Desc:$
   Little Chiba is known to have a lot of cyber-docs working in the area.
Also, it is one of the Yakuza's favorite hangouts. As you are walking down the
street, you realize that the Yaks must make sure no trouble wanders into this
area. You see several gangers but do not recognize the gang. They give you the
eye as you pass. Several people pass you walking with a dazed look on their
face and that "I just had surgery" walk that you recognize. A guy wearing a
familiar symbol on his jacket walks past you with a nod.

   This room is dimly lit and you see several of what could pass for operating
tables, but they look very unclean. You see a rat in the corner gnawing on
what looks like to be an eyeball. The tools of the trade look sort of rusty
and you are starting to have second thoughts about coming to this place to get
some cyber. You see a stack of body bags in the corner and realize that they
are not empty. You wonder if you are next.

   This part of the street is called Dragon's walk. Legend has it that when
there was a gang war and Little Chiba was being invaded by a Troll gang, a
young Eastern Dragon appeared and toasted a lot of the trogs. He then walked
up and down this street healing each of the fallen defenders and left. This
area has been a peaceful haven ever since. There is even a meet going down
with several Yaks and what looks like a mafia thug. The smell of sushi and
other Japanese food wafts in from the west, and you see a small electronics
shop to the east. A small alley leads off to the southeast.

Japanese man who has that ex-corp look to him. When asked he says he used to
do R&D, but left Japan when his daughter goblinized and was sent to Yomi. He
sighs and says, "The past is the past. How can I help your with your future?"

street is typical of the area, cleaner than most of the shadowy streets. There
are paper lanterns hanging up and down this street, most of them with Japanese
symbols and pictograms. The babble of voices from people float down this
street, somewhat muted by the distances. To the south you see a Street Doc's
biz and another street to the southeast.

there is no security as of yet. No Star or Knight Errants at all.  This area
seems to have been hit by a blast of some sort. You overhear some people
talking about how the street got it's name. It seems a runner tried to toss a
grenade, and the stupid fragger threw the pin instead. Well he was carrying
enough explosives on him to scorch this entire street. It totally destroyed
the street sign, so the locals call this "The Big Mistake". In Japanese it is
Daidoji. There is even a crater over to the side where the chummer blew up.

set of cyber eyes with some enhancements already in them, it does look like it
would cost a pretty penny, but hey it looks worth it. There is a sign on the
wall that reads: LL = Low light vision, TH = Thermographic vision, EM =
Electronic magnification, OM = Optical Magnification, FC = Flare Compensation.

Desc:$
   The Strip is alive with action. You see the first of the multitude of Cyber
shops to the east and west. You  have heard that the Cyber strip of Little
Chiba has some of the best ware this side of the ocean. The sounds of
different languages around you tells you how far some the people have traveled
to visit here. There are a few yakuza mixed in with the crowd. There is a
small shop to the west and a somewhat larger shop to the east.

Name:	White Oak Clinic
Desc:$
   This chop shop is has a few customers in it whether waiting to be served,
or resting up from some slight surgery. There are several posters on the walls
and several customers have their shirts off and you can see the yakuza tattoos
on their exposed skin. The doc and his aides are all Asian, Japanese if you
had to name a flavor. In the corner a sumo match , that is being broadcast
from Japan, is on the trid and several of the customers are watching it
intently, as if they had big money riding on the outcome.

Name:	Billy Bob's Body Shop
Desc:$
   The doors to this place sized for a medium sized human, if you were an ork
or troll you would have squeeze yourself in.  As you walk into this place a
silence falls upon the place. You think, no you know everyone is looking at
you. There are several patrons looking at you like you were scum. The sound of
a country western song is the only thing breaking the silence in this place.
The doc is wearing a cowboy hat and speaks with a southern drawl. There are a
couple of sets of horns on the wall. A small karaoke machine is off to one
side and there is also a couple of posters as well. It looks like this place
is regular hangout for people from the CAS, never mind it being a street doc's
place. I'd suggest getting my biz done fast and getting the drek outta here.

a very large cyber shop. The crowd looks a bit thinner in this area, and the

Name:	Black Ocean Body Enhancements.
Desc:$
   This place is busy as drek. You see some samurai dressed in street gear
while others wear suits worth thousands of nuyen. This places reeks of
money. The chairs for people to wait in are real oak, and the carpet is white
and red and looks stain-proof. There are several paintings on the walls and
there is Japanese flute music playing in the background. There is a very
pretty Asian woman in what looks like a real silk kimono serving refreshments
to all of the customers. Most weapons are checked at door, except for the men
in black suits who come and go freely. There is a large poster on the wall.
The more expensively dressed samurai are being handled by the owner himself
while the rest of the customers are approached by one of the apprentices.

   Holy Drek, this is one of Soriyama's places. Soriyama is the best in the
biz when it comes to any type of cyber or bioware. He is the one that works on
the Elite Japanese bodyguards for the Emperor and his fees are very high. He
has a lot of children and it looks like this place is run by one of them. This
place is medium sized and has an upstairs and downstairs to it. The walls are
white and the feeling of professional just reeks from this place. The
receptionist, a pretty Hispanic lady, informs you that the Cyber ware
enhancements are done on the second floor by Dr. Shi-Jan Soriyama.(Ahh
Soriyama's 4th son), and his wife Dr. Keisha Soriyama does bioware
enhancements on the lower level (so she means the basements duh).

look on your face she tells you it is a body paint job, and last for a couple
of months. It is permeable so her skin can breath, and yes she has it all
over, and gives you a wink. There are a couple of gangers hanging in here,

shops in the area, seeing what they are not offering and filling in the gaps,
so to speak. The rooms are painted in a soft baby blue and sounds of the ocean
waves lapping on the shores are being played as background music.

Hmmm, this might be a good place to dump some bodies while you're at it. There

they may start when they have an actual building before they will be more
alert for sabotage.

   This room is very neat and clean. It is all white except for the steel
operating table, and next to it is a tray with allergy free operating tools on
it.. There are computer displays on the walls, and seem keyed to the Doc's
voice. You are sure you made the right choice in coming here.

   This room is painted black and has computer display screens on the walls.
There is a large steel grey operating table with laser operating tools next to
it. The air smells crisp and fresh almost as if you were outside on a good day
on the mountains. The floor is tiled in black and grey patterns. Something is
odd but you just can't put your finger on it.

Name:	Backroom of the Chrome Dragon
Desc:$
   This is the HQ for the Steel Dragon gang. If you are not a dragon and walk
back here you are asking for trouble. They are all human and mostly Asian. The
older members are pretty cybered and some of them look to leave the gang to
join the Yakuza. There are beds here and a couple of tables for eating and
planning. The entire back wall is covered by a mural of a Great Eastern Dragon
with gleaming metallic skin on top of a hill overlooking a Japanese castle
with the sun in back of the castle highlighting it. The room is otherwise
painted a dark grey.

Name:	The Fire meeting room
Desc:$
   This room is done in shades of red with the characters for fire and flame
on the walls. Also there are paintings of dragons breathing fire hanging here
as well. There is a circular table in the center of the room and unlike the
rest of the inn there are chairs to go with it. Also in the middle of the
table, actually part of it is a small but powerful white noise generator.

Name:	Saotome's Furniture
Desc:$
   This small, bright shop features a small but exquisite selection of
Japanese furniture. A row of futons and frames occupies one wall; rolled up
tatami mats in various sizes lean against another. Tables, closets and wall
hangings are also on display. There's even an antique wooden tub tucked away
in one corner. (^mOOC^n: The clothing chest can't be picked up once it's dropped,
so make sure you put it down in the right place.)
