Name:	Beyond the heavy wrought iron gates
Desc:$
   A lengthy stretch of road paved with cobblestones twists and winds its way
uphill and through the thickets of trees and plants. It eventually opens up to
an open area infront of an area that widens considerably, with part of its
pathway breaking off towards the side of a piece of earth jutting up from the
west. The main path, however, continues along to the north, traversing its way
through the tranquil woodland scenery. The massive wrought iron gates of the
estates outer wall dominate the landscape to the south, along with its natural
and modern barrier of metal and flora, namely in the form of trees and
overgrown ivy covered hedges. A relatively concealed drive large enough to
accomodate a truck can be noticed winding its way northeast along a side path.

Name:	Nearing the estates inner wall
Desc:$
   The cobblestone pathway eventually winds itself up towards the interior
wall of the estate, which actually sits above this section of earth on a
natural ledge. Most of its sides are laced with large limestone blocks to
flatten and reinforced some areas, while others are completely covered and
draped with ivy and other climbing plantlife bold enough to make its way
skyward. A single, albeit large elevator door marks the entrance, and is lined
with stone that leads into the wall itself, complete with commsystem built
into the cove to one side, and several security cameras in key locations.

   This large elevator has been constructed with all the bells and whistles
one would expect from such a lavish estate. All of the metal surfaces are
gilded in sterling silver filagree, while the rest of its walls and ceiling
are made from flat, carved slabs of lightly coloured wood. The panel is silver
plated as well, and all of the buttons are labeled in inlaid sperethiel
characters for their designations.

which is obscured by the large trees that dominate the landscape about the
estate. A long pathway of paved stones lined with larger, roughly hewn stones

estates main residence. Back to the south stands a large elevator for
visitors, while off to the east stands a small, but astheticly pleasing guard
house for the estates security.

best use of its limited space available, and is just as aesthetically pleasing

toys to be found being put to use. Security camera feeds are watched by
guards, who in turn keep in touch with their patrol counters that wander

amongst three distinct pathways. To the north stands a large archway
constructed of cut and worked stone, the keystone of which is set with several
detailed symbolic carvings, while other portions of it are covered in climbing
plants that drape down over its entrance. Along the arch are Sperethiel
symbols, carved into the stones themselves and inlaid with precious metals,
which glimmer and almost glow. The ^Lsymbols^N upon the masterfully cut stones
read: "^LOzidano teheron, milessaratish. Imo medaron co versakhan.^N" To the west
and east run pathways on between the two interior walls, which has trees of
various sizes and species planted along their lengths.

Desc:$
   The sense that this mansion is massive in the proportions seen from outside
are mirrored in its interior. The ceilings are higher than some cathedrals,
and the beautiful works of art that line the extensive walls, meticulous
pieces of work that most private collectors would murder their own family for.
This room is a perfect example of what seperates the rich, from the wealthy,
and its quite simply put, proportion. Several sets of ornately decorated and
carved wooden doors are set into the walls, giving access to other rooms of
the mansion, while the massive room itself continues to stretch along almost
endlessly to the north.

Name:	A simply massive, high ceiling room
Desc:$
   This room was designed for one particular purpose, intended to awe any
visitors with its simply massive proportions and spacious construction. This
single room itself is large enough to fit most houses, and luxury is the name
of the game. Fine paintings of ranging degree and scenery line the room, along
with an occasional suit of armour spaced along its length, preciously crafted
weapons and shields held effortlessly by their strong grips, each one of a
different design than the last. The top of the high ceiling is dominated by a
massive ^Wcrystal^N chandelier that pours light down upon almost the entire area,
behind which the artistic beauty of the ceiling paintings can be enjoyed in
full visibility.

Name:	At the foot of the staircases
Desc:$
   These stairs are more akin to hallways that lift and span themselves up
along the walls of this vaulted room, stretching up towards the heavens. The
stairways themselves are lined with beautifully columns constructed of white
marble washed clean of any inperfections, which travel up along the curved
walls to the floors above. The central set of stone steps descends down a
level to the north, offering entrance to the room itself the staircases are
built along. A large circular pool of water can be seen from here, covering
most of the floor and reflecting the sunlight as it pours in from the northern
facing windows.

Desc:$
   A wide circular pool of water, roughly six meters deep, is displayed
proudly as the rooms distinguishing feature.  Surrounding its edges, which
span most of the floor, sit twelve small statues, some of which are more
simplistic, while others are intricate and delicate in their construction and
design. Each one holds some value, obviously, but as to what value it is,
isn't readily available from just the statues alone. The winds topping the
northern end of the wall allow miniscule amounts of light to filter in,
allowing only those with an accute sense of sight to take in the artistic work
put into the surfaces here.

the furnishings look like they belong in a museum moreso than as a decorative
piece for a meal. A lengthy cherrywood slab crafted from a single piece of
wood stretches along with the room, and has the capablity of seating atleast
several dozen diners with room to spare. The acoustic qualities of the hall
allows one to barely raise their voice to be heard across its expanse, thanks
mostly in part due to the articulate angles and design of the vaulted ceiling
and walls. Sunlight from the beautiful stained glass windows lining the upper
portion of the walls allows multi-coloured shades of colours to spill down

Name:	Inside a large kitchen
Desc:$
   This expansive kitchen is looks perfectly in place with its proportions and
decorative, yet effective design and application of what space is offered it.
It is quite obvious that nobody but the hired help sees much of this room, but
even that isn't enough to keep it from being pleasing to the eye, as well as
having a comfortable feel to it. Some portions are set aside from the more
modern accomodations, along side which the mechanism and design harkens back
to an age long past. A small team of cooks and servants mill about, seeing to
the cuisine preperations of the manner estate, all of whom look well fed, and
frankly, quite happy to be working in such a place, since it certainly came
with its own benefits. The scenery beyond the large windows offer a great
backdrop while working, and slows down the pace of a normally fast and hectic
demeanor that most kitchens imply.

Name:	A massive grand ballroom
Desc:$
   Elegance in design, as well as an almost over the top space in which to
house it, that is the hallmark of a grand ballroom, and this one certainly
does not disappoint. Its vaulted cathedral ceilings are designed to not only
be aesthetically and artistically pleasing to ones eye, but also act as an
echo chamber, allowing one to hear someone at nearly its other end while
speaking at a casual volume. The floors are polished smooth to an extent that
they act as nearly as mirrors, and are crafted from the highest quality wood
that money can buy, and considering their sole purpose is to be stepped upon,
it says quite a bit about the expense the owner went through when building
this mansion.

off to meet in the central section of the gardens, while small stonework

pathways are lined with carved stone benches, etched with old germanic runes,

considering their placement. Each one is spanned on either side by oak trees,
as well as redwood and other species that aren't native to this portion of the

Name:	Before the oak tree archway
Desc:$
   Two massive oak trees dominate this portion of the garden, creating a wide
natural archway beneath it as the paths join together, one leading off to the
east, another to the west, and the archway itself to the north. The trees
themselves look to be older than most creatures on earth, and gave the
impression they were standing strong when some dragons were mere whelps in
comparison. The shade offered by the lush canopy of high reaching branches,
along with the cool trickle and movement of water through the cut stone
irrigation and fountains washes over the air here, causing a cool, but
comfortable breeze.

Name:	Along the garden pathways
Desc:$
   The hanging gardens display their splendors and make a magnificent view for
any who step foot into the back of the expansive estate. Flowers of various
sorts, ranging from common to rare, every colour of the rainbow, dot the
landscape like some mosiac painting crafted by an artistic genius. The
pathways are lined with carved stone benches, etched with old germanic runes,
mostly depicting fertility, tranquility, splender and growth, suiting
considering their placement. Each one is spanned on either side by oak trees,
as well as redwood and other species that aren't native to this portion of the
world.

   In the shadow of the western wing lies a massive expanse of gardens, most
of which is seperated by beautifully crafted limestone hedges, most of which
have been dominated by climbing plants that drape themselves over them like
magnificent, lush green and white veined cloaks. The pathway begins to curve
off to meet in the central section of the gardens, while small stonework
waterways and irrigation fountains carry sustenance to every corner of the
gardens, articulating their way through the thickets of healthy flora.

lit well enough to be traversed. Both tops of the stairs come to meet infront

Two archways in particular are located across from one another, one leading
west, while the other heads off to the east, leaving the main hall to continue

   Two equally impressive heavy wooden doors adorn each side of the hallway
here, their trim and edges reinforced with bands of decorative wrought iron
for both aesthetic and durability against any attempts to bypass them. Only
the faintest glow of shaded bulb lamps in their etched prefices help to
alleviate the darkness that sprawls from end to end in the hallway, which lies
further down along to the north and south from here. An occasional suit of
armour, regal in appearance, are posted along on either side of the doorways
that branch off from here, apparently acting as symbolic guardians for the
manor.. or atleast you hope its a figurative, and not a literal reference.

ornate set of glass doors held together by decorative twists of wrought iron,

is in suit with the portion of hallway to the north, its length dotted with
various bits and pieces of artwork, ranging in size, shape and symbolism in an
assorted, apparently random order. The ceiling is set with ornate etched glass
hoods, which are oddly enough, not even turned on. Apparently the owner of
this estate either really likes saving electricity, or they obviously have
something against brightly lit rooms.

out the main drive leading up the estate, as well as the distant streets of
Gresham, the only remotely convincing detail that reminds one they are still

used for preservation and refurbishing of older works.

even a few dwarven runes that haven't seen use in many centuries.

   The scenery here changes quite drastically, considering the passages in
which led to this portion of the western wing hallway. Almost the entire
western length of the wall is covered by a single, massive stained glass
window, whos colours and hues can only be described as vibrant, powerful, and
brimming with an unseen sense of purpose. The figures depicted have obviously
elven features, whos fair complexion and noble features tend to stand out in
artwork even moreso than in life. The scene shows various elven warriors, some
of which are obviously less important, while others bear symbolic
representations in their poses and on their clothing and other garb, and in
some cases, their suits of armour. Several archers stand with their bows
posted into the ground, while others, surrounding a central figure of an elven
woman, of noted high standing, has amassed about her heavily armed soldiers
and warriors.

Name:	Along another stained glass window
Desc:$
   Another stained glass window continues the tradition along the western wall
here as well, though the colours and shades it has put to use, for lack of a
better word, are.. darker. In an almost exact copy of the window further north
of here, the depictions of various elves are plastered across its expanse.
There is, however, one major difference, aside from the symbolically darker
colour scheme used. Something isn't quite right with these elves, as their
normally flawlessly depicted complexions are marred by slender, delicate
thorn-like needles that press up from beneath their flesh, piercing through it
and dripping lightly with droplets of blood, which collect in tiny droplets
near their tips before being cast to the ground below them; whos flowering
plants, grasses and trees bask and soak up, their forms slightly twisted, and
in general give the impression that something, somehow, isn't quite right.

Name:	Along the eastern corridor
Desc:$
   This hallway travels away from the main hallway, and seems to lead in a
large curve about the eastern wing on the second landing. The light, what
little is offered, is only enough to take advantage of when it comes to
getting a closer look at the works of art that dominated the surfaces in this
section of corridor. To the southeast, sunlight can be seen in various
brighter hues and shades cast by their reflective filters, but none of it
quite reaches this far into the depths of the manner.

Name:	Passing a large stained glass window
Desc:$
   The scenery here changes quite drastically, considering the passages in
which led to this portion of the western wing hallway. Almost the entire
western length of the wall is covered by a single, massive stained glass
window, whos colours and hues can only be described as vibrant, powerful, and
brimming with an unseen sense of purpose. The figures depicted have obviously
elven features, whos fair complexion and noble features tend to stand out in
artwork even moreso than in life. The scene shows various elven warriors, some
of which are obviously less important, while others bear symbolic
representations in their poses and on their clothing and other garb, and in
some cases, their suits of armour. Several archers stand with their bows
posted into the ground, while others, surrounding a central figure of an elven
woman, of noted high standing, has amassed about her heavily armed soldiers
and warriors.

Name:	Along another stained glass window
Desc:$
   Another stained glass window continues the tradition along the western wall
here as well, though the colours and shades it has put to use, for lack of a
better word, are.. darker. In an almost exact copy of the window further north
of here, the depictions of various elves are plastered across its expanse.
There is, however, one major difference, aside from the symbolically darker
colour scheme used. Something isn't quite right with these elves, as their
normally flawlessly depicted complexions are marred by slender, delicate
thorn-like needles that press up from beneath their flesh, piercing through it
and dripping lightly with droplets of blood, which collect in tiny droplets
near their tips before being cast to the ground below them; whos flowering
plants, grasses and trees bask and soak up, their forms slightly twisted, and
in general give the impression that something, somehow, isn't quite right.

   Masks, a few dozen of them at least, adorn the walls atop the western
staircase. They vary greatly from one another for the most part, and in most
cases, have been crafted by cultures seperated by half the globe. There are
the almost obvious native american animal masks decorated with feathered
ridges and carefully carved and detailed symbols etched deeply into their
surfaces. Others are not quite as readily defined, some of them have oriental
features akin to mythological creatures, who bear wild eyes and meticulously
adorned tusks, and fangs and teeth. One common thread attaching them all is
the fact they all only feature a single eye socket, the right to be more
precise, giving the impression whoever these were made for has no use of their
left eye, and instead they were fully detailed on the masks themselves in its
place.

Name:	Infront of a massive set of wooden doors
Desc:$
   The two passages meet infront of a massive set of wrought iron wrapped
wooden doors, which reach almost up to the ceiling, which is an impressive
display considering the size of the archway that was constructed for them.
Their design makes an almost hermetic seal when closed, not even allowing the
faintest glow or ray of light through from the other side. In the center of
each of the doors are heavy, iron work knockers, crafted in the semblance of
some horrific gargoyle like creatures faces, their fanged mouths clenched
tightly about the top, which allows the rounded ball knocker to be struck
against their tongues. The carpets that line the floors look like they belong
in a museum, and it almost seems a tragedy that they aren't hung up on a wall
where they won't be tread upon.

   The living room is more extravegant than most rooms in the estate, its
walls and ceiling practically covered in murial like paintings of various

delicate and detailed art work. The edges of the vaulted ceiling, angled to
act as an echo chamber, are molded with exquisite ^Lblack ash^N wood carved trims.
Plush ^Lblack leather^n sofas of multiple sizes are scattered about infront of a
massive personal entertainment system, with speakers nearly six meters tall
and a widescreen holo-trid that puts most luxury class movie theatres to
shame. The lightning is kept to a minimum, and can be either manually or
automatically, since almost everything is controlled by a expert-driven
computer system, and simply awaits an audio command.

brim with electronics most third world countries have never even glimpsed. A
large executive desk is piled high with random scroll cases, mostly paper,
while others are written completely on electronic paper, a medium that can be
bent, rolled and stored like its mundane counterpart, but is dependant upon a
computer driven memory system that displays its details like a book page.

Name:	A sterile storage room
Desc:$
   This storage room is starkly different than most in the manor, as its
surfaces are metal and polished to a smooth shine, giving the room a feel more
akin to a surgical theatre. Compact folding shelves automatically extend out
and flip open with small mechanical ease due to their concealed electric
motors, which whir softly as they unfold and expand to be filled or lightened
of stored items. Various containers of practicall every type are available for
any sort of equipment or object needing to be stored, lining the room along
each of the walls.

Name:	Standing infront of a massive ash tree
Desc:$
   An absolutely massive white ash tree has been planted in the center of this
section of garden, and is larger than most trees one will ever witness in
their life time. It is, quite simply put, huge. The courtyard like alcove is
surrounded by the subtle curves of mason work etched and cut, which show no
tool marks to testify their creators hands having touched them, which is
rather surprising due to the sheer size and amount of work done. If one looks
carefully, they might be able to make out the zodiac represented with various
runes, some more common, while others are estoeric, and in some cases, simply
an unknown dialect. The thirteenth zodiac, it seems, is representing about the
ash tree standing in the middle. To the north stands a large, smoothly
polished slab of stone, which has been sealed into place at the entrance of
some sort of cavern.
