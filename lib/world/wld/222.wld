   You are very, very cold, and covered in chocolate ice cream.  Yummy.  A lot
of licking goes on in this room.  NOT IN A DIRTY WAY, you sicko.

Name:	Inside Starbuck's
Desc:$
   This coffee shop is disgusting.  Broken cups litter the floor, used coffee
filters ontop of the machines, syrup spilled all over everything.  Not at all
like the sparkling clean Starbuck's that we all know and love. People of all
races, sizes and colors start brawls, throwing tables and chairs -- just like
that one!  Oof... that musta hurt.

   You find yourself in a grostesque bathroom.  The mirrors covered in
splattered blood, the floors covered in splattered -- well, you don't want to

considering the toliets have been ripped from the floor and the plumbing most

Trees cut out the majority of the light, and the ground is sickeningly soft,
and it smells moldy.  You doubt any rainfall dries when it hits the ground,
and most likely just soaks into the thick duff coating the forest floor.  Each
step you take, your foot sinks about 3" down into the dead mush underneath
you.

   You nearly trip over a pile of bones lying in the middle of the path.  It's
impossible to determine the source of them, but it's a good bet they aren't
all animal. Pawprints of wolves, and other less pleasant creatures circle
around the pile and spoke off in all directions. Some movement catches your
eye off to the side, but by the time you look it's gone.  Perhaps it might be
better to move on.

   Here, the trees around you seem different.  Older.  More sinister.  It is
almost as if you had the feeling of tresspassing on their land. For a brief
moment, the impression hits you that you are walking through the ruins of an
ancient civilization.  Then, as quickly as it came, it disappears, leaving you
at a total loss to explain it. You are starting to feel downright unwelcome,
but that's nonsense.  Trees can't project emotions... can they?

   As you've trudged on,  your gaze has fallen steadily downward.  Because of
this, a massive log that has fallen across the path seems to thrust itself at
your legs, and you barely evade tripping over it. As you look back up, you see
that you have nearly literally stumbled upon what looks uncannily like a tree
graveyard.  Gargantuan tree trunks down to felled saplings are scattered here.
While you can discern no identifiable pattern, something tells you that their
placement wasn't quite accidental.  Also, though the dead trees all seem to
have broken and fallen over, there are no stumps to indicate their origin.
Chalk this one up to the continuing weirdness of this forest.

   The wind is more vicious here, no longer teasing, but really trying to
dismount you from the rocky cliff, which you dig into for dear life. To the
left of you, you can see a small platform, which looks like a good place to
rest.  The bad thing is that you cannot reach it from here, and will have to
climb further up the treacherous cliff and then drop down.

Name:	Forest
Desc:$
   The canopy overhead here is quite thick, with only a few rays of sunlight
lancing in during the  daylight hours.  Here and there squirrels scurry over
the tough bark of the trees, and birds flutter in the distance, just out of
view. Every now and then you hear a rustling in the undergrowth, as if
something were stalking you.  Watch your step, or you might very well end up
as dinner.

Desc:$
   A simple path of dirt, lined with duff and some tiny, low light plants,
surrounded in trees. You close your eyes for a moment and listen to the wind
whistling through the trees and the sound of your own squishy footsteps -- OW!
You doofus!  You can't walk with your eyes closed, ya know.  Not only are you
going to injure yourself, but something else might as well if you don't pay
attention.

Name:	Forest
Desc:$
   You have reached the edge of a small clearing.  The grass here has been
stomped down into a kind of matting.  It is quite dead, and somewhat dry as
well.  Smoking in this area might not be such a great idea. Maybe it's just
your imagination, but the limbs of the trees around the clearing seem to be
reaching in towards an oddly symmetrical rock in the center.  Closer
inspection of the rock reveals a number of druidic markings and pictograms of
various animals  indigenous to the region. Having heard the stories about
druids protecting their sacred places, you can't help but feel more than just
a little nervous about standing here.

Name:	Squishy Squish!
Desc:$
   The dark forest is dampening not only your clothing, but your mood as well.
Trees cut out the majority of the light, and the ground is sickeningly soft,
and it smells moldy.  You doubt any rainfall dries when it hits the ground,
and most likely just soaks into the thick duff coating the forest floor.  Each
step you take, your foot sinks about 3" down into the dead mush underneath
you.

   You place your hand on the railing and quickly withdraw it, the metal being
extremely cold.  As you step onto the metal flooring, it makes a loud noise,
and you jump slightly, but the boys below don't even seem to notice.  You
smell chemicals, sweat and blood.

   You make it halfway down the loud metal stairs, your hand freezing from
holding onto the railing.  With each step, the smell of blood, chemicals and
sweat gets stronger.  A few people stop to glance at you, but quickly return

   Your shoes pad along the bare, solid concrete flooring, echoing against the
equally as bare and bland walls. Everything smells of chemicals, sweat and
blood.  Also, of cleaning fluids.  You notice there's not a single mite of
dust anywhere around you, almost as if the place was cleaned obsessively.

   Millions of dollars worth of high-tech equipment fill this room. Cold,
steel shackles are welded to matching slates mounted into the walls, and blood
drips down from each.  Computers screens scroll encrypted messages and there
are so many buttons that you couldn't imagine that each one could possible
have it's own use.  Machinery operates from these computers and installs data
chips into the skulls of soldiers.

Name:	Behind the Bookcase
Desc:$
   Like in old movie mansions, you stand in a secret room behind a bookcase.
It's horrible.  Psycho-surgeons piece together random parts from all different
species, in what looks like an attempt to create super-soldiers.  Strongest
qualities from every being you could possibly imagine are crunched into
horrific looking monsters.

Name:	Parts Storage
Desc:$
   Soldiers drag in fresh corpses of all sorts of beings, and surgeons
carefully cut off individual limbs, then pass them down like some horrible
assembly line.  Drains in the floor suck gallons of blood down from around
your feet.  A 'Doctor' saws off a bladed arm from some creature and blood
spurts into your eye.  Disgusting, truely disgusting.  When they finish with a
body, the unwanted parts are discarded down a small ramp, which emits the foul
odor of rotting flesh.

   Here the finished "super-soldiers" are pushed down a ramp to who knows
where. The just roll on past you on a conveyor belt.  Quite disturbing,
actually. Each one leaks a little fresh blood, and reeks of chemicals.  The
conveyor belt is washed by a machine, small chunks of flesh and blood fall
off.  Ewwww *shudder*

   The body parts get passed into this room, and sewn together to create odd,
super-soldiers.  Some with huge fangs, tiny heads and eyes on three foot
stalks, and arms that hang down to the floor.  But no matter how odd these
look, they still appear to be formidable opponents.

Desc:$
   Ah...memories. The smell of mystery meat and overcooked vegetables remind
you of your days in school.  Long tables are crowded with military boys, and
even a few women as well.  The bright, floresent lighting is almost blinding,
but you can see that the cafeteria continues to the north.

   The feeding process starts here.  A dozen freezers line up against the back
wall, and the workers pull slabs of meat and other unknown substances from
some of the refridgerators lined up next to the freezers. Aside from salt and
pepper, you see various bottles on the ingredients shelves with medical
labels.

   A Co-Ed shower.  How much would you have loved that in P.E.?  But no one
really looks at each other, they just scrub manically, and you begin to notice
the same scar on the nape of the neck on every single naked person. Oh,
chummer?  Don't drop the soap.
