   You stand at the grand entrance to the famed Telestrian Habitat. You look
up and you think you make out 15 floors on this megaplex. Back on the streets,
waves of elven hustle in and out of this HUGE megaplex, some carrying out
shopping bags, others bringing in with them a will to shop.

   The ground floor of the Telestrian Habitat has a very open and spacious
feel to it, due mainly to several mezzanine levels up around you, and the
resulting ceiling that looms several floors above. You see a sea of elven
shoppers, almost as far as the eye can see. The occasional elf bumps into you
as they swarm around in a shopping frenzy.

   The service counter at Midnight Streetwear is bustling with activity.
Adolescent elves come and go, some of them carrying their street savvy
purchases with them as they leave the store. At what looks to be a solid
wooden counter, young sales assistants finalizing customer purchases and give
you a greeting as you approach the counter.

   The ground floor of the Telestrian Habitat has a very open and spacious
feel to it, due mainly to several mezzanine levels up around you, and the
resulting ceiling that looms several floors above. You see a sea of elven
shoppers, almost as far as the eye can see. The occasional elf bumps into you
as they swarm around in a shopping frenzy.

Name:	The DarkSun Cafe
Desc:$
   The DarkSun cafe is an indoor version of an al fresco cafe and is situated
in the middle of the thoroughfare on the ground floor of the Habitat - an
island in an ocean of shoppers. You look down and you see a large symbol of a
stylised sun in black on a crimson background, which marks off the space the
cafe occupies. Tables and chairs are set up to the west and north west, where
weary shoppers sit to have a break and a perhaps a small snack, while the
service counter is to your north.

Name:	Ground Floor
Desc:$
   The ground floor of the Telestrian Habitat has a very open and spacious
feel to it, due mainly to several mezzanine levels up around you, and the
resulting ceiling that looms several floors above. You see a sea of elven
shoppers, almost as far as the eye can see. The occasional elf bumps into you
as they swarm around in a shopping frenzy.

Desc:$
   The ground floor of the Telestrian Habitat has a very open and spacious
feel to it, due mainly to several mezzanine levels up around you, and the
resulting ceiling that looms several floors above. You see a sea of elven
shoppers, almost as far as the eye can see. The occasional elf bumps into you
as they swarm around in a shopping frenzy.

   You are on the center of a path between two very large gardens with very
tall rainforest plants and trees that climb way up to the ceiling, some 500
meters up.  These trees never see the light of the sun, as they are kept alive
by the closed environment and lighting of the habitat itself.  Northwards you
see the elevators that take you out of the mall section and into the actual
corporate sectors of the Telestrian Habitat.

   The escalators are very ornate, with long glass crystalline guard rails and
a flexi-grip surface in which shoppers move up and down the escalators between
the two main levels of the Telestrian Habitat Shopping Center.  The flexi-grip
is designed to look like a marble, that morphs and changes to form into steps
along the escalator.  You are surrounded by the Telestrian Habitat Gardens, a
cultivated jungle of rainforest plants and trees that climb five hundred
meters up to the ceiling of the shopping center.  This horticultural
experiment has been very successful, for twenty years these plants have grown
without ever experiencing the wind of the outdoors or the light of the sun.

is where some of the best places are to find many a gift or a selfish splurge.

shopper traffic, the corner of the Mezzanine.  To the east is a store called
Paramount Imports, which caters to those who smoke, and to those who love
music.  Incense fills the air as you near the store.  Inside there are trendy
looking elves, lava lamps, and racks full of t-shirts, as well as cases full
of jewelry and trendy gear.

   A rush of shoppers moving from the east to the south wings, and vice versa
keep this area of the mall crowded during most of the shopping day.  There is
a sculpture here of some bizarre shapes looping through each other.  Under the
sculpture is the inscription in Sperethiel, "Knowledge and Wisdom must
balance, lest our knowledge be our enemy."  To the south is Aera Talismans, a
talismongery focused on Hermetic magic.

chips of modern, youth orientated bands. Around the store, various posters
fill the blank wall space, mainly elven bands from the well established
Neonbabies to the hottest up-and-coming poliband called Homeland, which
incidently is what is being played in the store. A hush comes over the store
as the music dies down and Ella's angelic voice cradles you as lifts you up to
heaven, then the music changes to raw static as the banshee's voices pierces
your ears as she claws your soul back down to hell. Oh, you also see a service
counter to the east.

Name:	Alequirrie's Formal Wear
Desc:$
   As you step inside this room the first thing that hits you is the smell of
fresh, new clothes. Surrounding you on all sides are sets of formal attire
that not only look snazzy, but are probably pretty pricy. Racks of suits and
dresswear line the main isle where you're standing, leading up to a large
mahogany counter with a nicely dressed elf standing behind it, waiting for you
to pick something with a large grin.

Desc:$
   The talismongery Aera Talismans is not well known for having the best and
most state of the art in magic, but it is well known for having some downright
high quality magical gear, from spell formulae to weapon foci.  The room seems
to have a glow to it, as several magical designs focus power into the room,
creating a mild, yet positive background count.  A glass case holds the more
intensely magically imbued items and spell formulae.

   Paramount Imports is the place to find smoking supplies in Tir Tairngire.
On one wall are countless 'water pipes' (read: bongs) of all shapes and sizes,
everything from skull bongs to ceramic hookas to 5 meter tube bongs, all
designed for the ultimate in um... smoking pleasure.  Available also are an
array of incense, apparel, and even lava lamps.  In the corner of your eye you
spot them opening up a panel and going into a back room.  Hmmmm....

   This back 'storeroom' seems to have another purpose than what they probably
tell the Tir Tairngire Peace Force.  As you walk in, the smell of something
herbal hits your nostrils and gives you a subtle light-headed feeling.  At the
end of the back room is an elf with dreadlocks wearing a Concrete Dreams
shirt, dealing out baggies filled with something herbal and green to anyone
who wishes to purchase them.  People in groups pass pipes around with each
other, seemingly trying out the selection sold in the legitimate part of the
store.

   On each side of the hallway are two rust-colored painted metal doors,
separating this hallway from the utility and control offices on each side of
the room.  The office doors have the numbers "9", west, and "10", east,
painted on them in black stencilled spraypaint, using large letters.  There is
a dull chemical smell in the air, making the air taste vaguely putrid.  The
doors on each side of the room have passkey systems on them, electronic keys
with fingerprint verification.  Over Room 10, a security camera hangs, and its
passkey system includes an additional retinal scanner.

The walls are a plain metal, as are the office doors, which are painted with a
dull rust color.  The doors have black numbers painted on them, stenciled,
probably painted with black spraypaint.  A security camera in the corner pans
back and forth, scanning the hallway north, and the hallway southwest.  A sign

   A large mainframe and server center is built here, in a large, clean, white
octagonal room, filled with many engineers who oversee the control systems for
all the mechanics on the lower levels.  Screens and terminals are layed out at
control stations, each belonging to every servo, gear, and track on the
ground, mezzanine, and lower habitation levels.  The room buzzes loudly, the
sound of the millions of joules of power used to control this section of the
Telestrian Habitat Control system.  This mainframe only houses a single SPU,
connected to others of its kind.

the borders of the countries from before the Year of Chaos.  Upon close
examination, a label shows the globe as dated to the year 2000.  The globe is
in perfect condition, most likely a replica.  The air smells of incense, and
there is an incense burner on the desk with some ash in it.
