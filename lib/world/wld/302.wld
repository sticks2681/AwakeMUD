Name:	A bend in the road
Desc:$
   After leaving miles behind to get finally here to the outer districts of
Seattle. A really broad street continues to the north-east and to the north an
even huger construction complex can be seen. After this great view you also
just could turn around and try to get back to downtown.

   The road continues towards the north-east. Back to the south-west you still
can see Seattle downtown in quite some distance. To the west is the huge
industry complex, but it seems even better guarded with monitoring euqipment
than anticipated. As you watch for any more hints, you hear low roaring noises
coming from this industry plant.

Name:	The road along an inustry complex
Desc:$
   Continuing along the road you realize that it is pretty much a straigh
line, no curves or bends, simply a road leading to nothing? It most probably
is just the only mean for entering to this complex, besides trying to kill
yourself by trying to get through this high sec fence. Back to the south-west
you can still think you can get a slimpse on Seattle downtown in the distance.
To the west is the huge industry complex. The outer parameter fencing seems to
emit a distinct humming, which you can hear once the roaring ceases.

Name:	The road along an inustry complex
Desc:$
   The road already seemed like it never was going to end, but in the distant
north-east you spot an end which also might be a turning anvil. Due to the
huge buildings you still haven't had any chance to get a glimpse what is
inside these walls. Judging by the security measurements taken it must be
something important!

   Away from their work, some people try to enjoy the served food in here. The
place itsself is not in a very good shape, which also seems to be true for the
meals...  But at least it seems that you can hang out here without being
bothered too much.

   You are in the archway of that really big construction complex. As the
outer door was marked with the letter 'A', there might be at least one more
building like this one located somewhere else at this site. From inside a lot
of different noises can be heard, and with a glimpse through the door, you can
see lot of different shapes which hardly resemble any known vehicles.

   As you finally gave a fine display of showing you courage, you are just a
step away from the main entrance door. The whole complex seems to be
rectangular, at least this would be a fair guess by looking at the ceiling. To
the west spans the whole size of this factory floor, whereas to the NW and SW
you can sneak along the walls.

   Now you arrived in the archway of the construction complex. Here on the
outer door were several warnings about safety rules to be followed, a big
letter 'B' and some more stuff you didn't care about yet. Idling around here
doesn't seem clever, as the door can be easily overseen from the whole inner
yard and even the tower building is clearly visible from this point - and vice
versa! As you try to peek through the door, you see many different shapes and
constructions whose purpose still is unknown. You should have read more latest
stuff on inventions and flying- but now it's too late!

   As you got your guts together, you are now just a step away from the
workers' entrance. To the north stretches the diagonal of this hall, which
still seems flooded with strange constructs. Maybe one could have a better
idea once getting closer. The walls are to the NW and NE here, or you better
wimp out to the south- back into the yard, where all these nice people at!

   This room contains hardcopies of every crashlog that has occured to the mud
since it was first booted. A White board hangs high on one wall, with hundreds
of lines of text, and small diagrams tagged on it haphazardly. In the middle
of a room a lone desk sits, piled high with paper. The sounds of shuffling can
be heard from somewhere amongst the litter.
