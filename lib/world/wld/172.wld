Name:	A Check-Out Counter
Desc:$
   Standing about 1.3 meters high and about 5 meters long, the marble inlaid
counter has various people running around behind it taking calls, doing
background checks and taking money.   Each counter here is set-up to do
instant SIN checks, and checkouts. Any item you purchase in this store,
chances are good the clerk calls up to this desk first.  This is also the only
place you can buy Ammo in the Store, as you see heavy boxxes of ammo set in
cases and the background.  Just Ahead of you is Aisle B.

like its chamber exploded seven ways to Tuesday.

and there is even a cyberterminal at each seat, probably to access a variaty
of news and magaizine articles. Just ahead of you is the reception counter set
behind glass windows, the woman behind the counter looks up at you as you
