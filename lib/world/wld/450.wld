Name:	Microsoft Way
Desc:$
   Many years ago, this long road that curves southeast then east off Burton
was the main road leading to the world headquarters for a prototypical
megacorporation that once had extensive worldwide power, monetary,
legislative, and other wise.  They have since been sold to Renraku, and their
headquarters abandoned as social conditions in Redmond went downhill with the
Crash of 2029, but the buildings are still there.  You can see them in the
distance.  Surrounding you is a field of toxic dust, with the pungent smell of
ammonia.  Up ahead, just a ways down the road, it looks like you can see some
dustdevils, moving in a pattern one could only deduce as intelligent.

   The chemical smell in the air gets obscenely thick at this point.  Large
chunks of the road are colored bright green, with chemical streaks of red
through them.  The pungent chlorine and ammonia smell in the air is enough to
make one feel like their eyes are going to boil out of their skull, and their
nasal cavity is going to melt.  The gray colored complex to the east is barely
visible through the drifting dust in the air, carrying its toxic essence.

Name:	Microsoft Way - Curve
Desc:$
   The road bends here, east to the Bargain Basement, built on what was once
the Redmond Campus, the world headquarters for the turn of the century
Microsoft corporation.  The dust is thick here, thicker than it was on Burton,
a toxic stench fills the area, making anyone without breathers or at least a
bandana over the mouth unable to breathe without coughing up both lungs, their
esophagus and a large chunk of their digestive tracts, maybe some brains out
the nose.  It's seriously that bad.  Your skin burns upon contact with the
death dust of South Redmond.  A stoplight was here, but all that is left of it
is corroded remains.

Name:	Microsoft Way at Roadblock
Desc:$
   A wall of stacked melted tires, slowly bubbling from contact with the
poison air is stacked 3 meters high, looking like an ungodly wall of almost
living filth.  Slowly, the rubber of these old tires bubbles and lets off
steam, reacting slowly to the pungent chemicals in the air.  It looks like
this roadblock is maintained by something or someone, as newer tires have been
placed at the top while the tires below have become almost jelly.  A metal
sign has been bolted into the tires, and a gate has been set up in a vehicle
sized gap between the two sides of the roadblock.

   To the west, a large roadblock of burnt and bubbling tires stacked three
meters high blocks the way, save for a small gate, one lane thick to let
traffic in and out of the Bargain Basement complex farther east.  The air is
thick with the pungent burning smell of something like ammonia, but more
bitter, a smell that seems to be carried in the toxic dust that flutters about
the area.  A large green stain on the road streaks across the lanes of the
potholey cracked Microsoft Way, created by the chemical reaction of the last
rainstorm with the toxic dust that coats everything here.

Desc:$
   Both sides of this road, once the expressway that was used to separate the
Microsoft internal world from the rest of Redmond proper, are completely
covered with that toxic chemical soot that is common to this area.  Dust
storms make goggles and breathers an absolute necessity, as someone or
something has made this a dead, poisonous part of the world.  Not a tuft of
scrub grass, not a shrub, not a critter can survive here, just the occasional
spirit dust devils that flutter about with malicious intent.  To the east you
can see lights through the clouds of dust.

Desc:$
   The dust seems to intelligently move around a large complex of buildings, a
complex very modern in 2020, before the world economy dropped through the
bottom with the Great Crash of 2029.  The complex looks largely abandoned
except for some lights in a few parts, where squatters have made their camps,
many of them "Employees" of the toxic shaman who controls this area.  Graffiti
covers parts of the complex, unintelligible, to even the most street smart
gangers.  Or the most learned of magical theorists, to speak of a more
appropriate context.

Desc:$
   The west wing of Microsoft Redmond World Headquarters, now abandoned, is
several stories high, and is filled with nightmares that you don't even want
to imagine, much less walk into.  Astrally, this place's background count is
off the scale, an intensely forboding vibe filling the air.  Mundanes would
not notice such a thing, but mundanes would have a very bad feeling walking
through this place.  Especially with the human corpses on stakes that one can
view close to the west wall.  The air feels and smells poisonous, despite the
lack of the death dust that covers the road westward.  There is an electrical
buzzing sound in the air, indicative of some sort of generators being used
nearby.

   The sign still stands over the place, with a shredded Windows '28 Advance
Server flag fluttering in the breeze above the large marble sign, defaced with
graffiti in red, blue, green, and white, of many bizarre designs.  The great
marble sign reads, chiseled in marble, "Microsoft(R)".  A toxic smell is in
the air, an ammonia smell that you can taste.  A once luxurious glass entrance
is open wide, as the glass was shattered by gangers years ago.  Inside, it
looks almost pitch black.  Looking northward into the front door area, you see
what looks like some bones strewn about.  A wall on the side of the open
entrance reads, "^RKEEP OUT - Ruford Gates, Owner^n".

Desc:$
   The east wing looks like it was hit by a low yield nuclear device.  The
seven floors of the wing are collapsed onto each other, the whole structure
caved into itself.  You see balls of light gathering around parts of the
place, and you smell a tinge of death in the deadly toxic smell that
proliferates the area.  The road farther east is blocked off by dunes of the
toxic dust that is common to the road west of here.  The sky is always gray,
and the sun very rarely reaches the earth here.

   A once luxurious modern glass revolving door system, tall and beautiful,
pristine and perfect has been shattered and reduced to some glass powder and
shards broken up into tiny pieces over the years.  Inside the innards of the
old Micro$oft complex are dark, with occasional lights created by the toxic
spirits native to this place, and to the denizens of what is called Bargain
Basement, the underground mall built in what were once the security levels of
Microsoft's grand world headquarters.  A human skull, and some bones are
strewn about.  Shell casings surround the strewn remains of whoever died here
some time ago.

perma-mold that just sticks to the concrete underneath.  The area smells of
mud and death, decay and a dung-like earthy smell.

   The walls in this chamber are bare, roughly hewn stone. There is no grey
luminous fungus. No water. No corpses (well, none yet). The floors are stained
with a good deal of old and long since dried blood, which streaks its way
across the expanse in a manner that suggests quite a struggle ensued here, a
rather bloody struggle at that. Burned into the wall in a ragged, uneven hand
are the words, "Good luck.", and something in the back of your mind tells you
that you'll be needing it. Another archway has been carved into the stone to
the east, almost as large as the previous one, but much, much wider.

Name:	The Bleak Altar
Desc:$
Descending through the circular opening hidden by the queen's bulk, you find
yourself in a wide chamber, with the rough stone wall above becoming a ladder
down to the floor. The floor is covered in a thick, cushy purple carpet, woven
in thread-of-gold with scenes depicting the Biblical Revelation. At the north
end of the chamber, rising up at the top of three teirs of stone steps, stands
a massive altar. It is constructed purely of insect spirit chitin, bound together
with trollhide leather at the joints. Hung upon the walls are banners with swastikas
on them, pictures of Adolph Hitler, Lorcraft, and a single tapestry of the Reverend
Matthews himself - in his human form. From the ceiling hangs eight massive lights,
each one a wrought-iron cage at the end of a heavy black chain. They throw a bright
but flickering light throughout the chamber. Upon the altar are spread out several
copies of the Bible, in English, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Syrian Aramaic. The smell
of pungent incense hangs in the air as thickly as did the smell of death above.

Name:	The Chamber of the Queen
Desc:$
   Easily the largest single chamber in the entire hive, it spans nearly fifty
meters across and another fifty meters high, it is, quite simply, massive.
Below is a vast abyss of darkness that descends almost infinitesimally down
into the depths of the earth, and the only thing available for purchase
beneath ones feet is the three meter wide bridge that stretches out over to
the center of the cavern. In the center lies a huge, uneven platform of
unworked stone, measuring ten to twenty meters wide in some points, while at
others there is barely enough room for a single human to stand. Perched atop
one of the large 'spires' dotting the island is something nightmares are made
of, an invae queen, who seems to be standing on a small, circular slab of
carved stone that seems oddly out of place. Several metahuman corpses are
strewn about, some partially eaten, while others are unconcious, being
prepared to be merged with invae spirits to provide the hive with more workers
or soldiers.

Name:	The Rookery
Desc:$
   The rookery is tended by a small army of heavily armoured, four-armed bugs,
who don't necessarily look happy when being left to their own devices, let
alone when they're being interrupted from working by outsiders. The cavern
itself is much like the last, splotches of luminous grey fungus partially
light up some areas, while others are bathed in absolute darkness, leaving you
to wonder what other creepy things might be hiding away in them. A good deal
of bodies are here, some moving, some not, and while their forms are vaguely
recognizable as humanoid, theres obviously something horribly wrong with them.
Most look to be a cross between metahumans and a type of insect, ranging from
only a couple of minor details, to some who are almost fully converted into
large bug-like creatures. The sound of chitinous shells scraping across solid
rock drowns out most of the sounds pouring in from the adjoining chambers,
which is more than enough to make the hair on the back of ones neck rise with
terror.

Name:	The Nursery
Desc:$
   The 'nursery' consists of two high, narrow ridges of stone with a roughly
hewn bridge spanning across the vast expanse between them. On either side of
the bridge are two wide, immensely deep pits, from which the constant sounds
of shrieking and agonized howling, accompanied by the disgusting, wet, squishy
and almost paper-like ripping sounds of flesh and sinew being peeled from the
bone wafts up to fill the chamber above. One should be thankful that the
luminous grey fungus only covers portions of the high ceiling here, whose
light fails to pierce the utter darkness down below, saving ones psyche from
witnessing the horrors that are taking place there. A sliver of light spills
down from above, allowing a subtle glimpse to one of the higher chambers,
albeit the climb looks treacherous, and thats just putting it lightly.

Desc:$
   The massive maw of an archway opens into a chamber even more cavernous than
itself, while the platform extends only a few feet into the room before
splitting off to the left and right, sloping down to the floor that descends
even further into its depths. The walls have large holes gouged out of them,
apparently for storage purposes, and splotches here and there of that luminous
grey fungus from before can be seen giving off a faint light, just enough to
offer a glimpse at the true horrors that stand before anyone entering this
section. All over the walls and floors scuttle an army of two-meter long,
black chitin-shelled insect spirits, none of which seem overly pleased by your
arrival.

   This platform-like piece of rough stone lifts itself out above the water
level, and is coated in more of the same slimey grey mass that covers many of
the previous sections of tunnel. The floating corpse depository lies back to
the west, while to the north a massive archway has been carved out and stands
to the east like the open jaws of some horrific beast, awaiting for some poor
unfortunate soul to step in and be devoured. The ceiling here is raw stone,
uncoated and unworked, but still occasionally drips with water in some places,
most of which runs off back down to join the large pool from before. The
scuttling noise here is almost deafening, and seems to be coming from beyond
the open archway.

Name:	The End of the Shaft
Desc:$
   The shaft ends suddenly with the chamber widening a good deal, and as you
either plunge through or climb down the musty air filled area, you quickly
come to realize there is a meter or so of water beneath you, which seems to be
where the sludge trickle pours down into and collects. Scattered around the
dark, murky river are corpses, which float about aimlessly. Most appear to be
horribly mutilated and bloated from sitting in the water for so long, and
whats not already fully decayed are being devoured relentlessly by maggots and
other little nasties you probably don't even want to know about. The only real
information you can gather from them is that they are mostly metahumans, or
rather, what once were metahumans. The sound of thick, trickling water and the
soft, steady munching produced by the maggots fills the chamber, which
stretches off towards the east to what looks to be a bit of dry land.

   Umm... yipe. It seems the floor simply isn't. A tunnel runs straight down,
and the remnants of the murky sludge river pours down over its edge into the
abyss below. The walls of the shaft are coated in that all too familiar fleshy
grey coating, though here it seems to be growing even thicker, and stone below
it can no longer be seen. Coils of skin-like matter hang from it, which could
perhaps provide some purchase for climbing up or down. They're slick with
gunk, but hey, won't know til you make the attempt.

   The ooze river only flows halfway through this section of the tunnel, at
which point the stone floor gives way to a fleshy grey covering. A closer look
reveals that the material covering the floor is the same squishy, fleshy grey
matter that nearly encased some of the previous portions of the tunnel
chambers. The stench of decay wafts in from both directions, but the backdraft
from the room before seems a bit stronger and muskier. The god awful scuttling
noise has grown louder, and lightly vibrates the matter that covers the floor
and walls as it travels along the passageways.

   Scattered throughout this large chamber are the bodies of various humans,
some of which are bald-headed former Humanis members (as the patches on their
uniforms imply), while the majority of them are metahumans of every type, each
in various stages of decay. The floor is dry here, but covered in the same
flesh grey coating from the previous chambers, but due to the amount of
corpses here it makes it quite hard to navigate ones way through the room. The
stench of death is almost unbearable, and it hangs almost literally in the
air, marking this chamber as some sort of perverse graveyard of some sort...
or even worse, and more likely, its a storage room for leftovers that might
make up a meal at a later time.

splits into two at this point, with the river of fastly thickening gray goo
flowing down the left-hand path.

   As you continue down the spiral the water is beginning to become heavier,
which is now a fraction of an inch deep and covers most of the floor. Its

eddying around your feet with each step. The smell of old, rotting meat is
mildly recognizable, and from somewhere down below the vague sound of
something, or perhaps somethings in a plural manner, can be heard scratching.

rivulets of condensing water seem to flow underneath these patches, and an
oddly familiar, but too faint to place scent is beginning to add itself to the
mugginess that hangs in the air.

stone. Occasionally a blast of air howls from deeper down in the shafts, much
like the pressure changes one would experience in a mine shaft. When these
gusts hit the doors, they shift upon their moorings and the air racing between
them produces that hellish shrieking that can be heard in the adjoining

Name:	The Baptismal
Desc:$
   A glass tank large enough to fully immerse a large human sits in this room,
filled with water, with a ladder leading up into it for easy access. The
wooden paneling infront of the tank is raised slightly higher than the rest of
the floor, which is painted white, along with the walls, some of which seems
relatively fresh. The room smells heavily of chlorine, which may explain the
need to keep repainting the wooden surfaces here.

   The "pews" here are simply planks of wood with a few coats of white paint
sitting on top of plasticrete cinder blocks. Strewn about on them are tracts
and leaflets, chocked full of Humanis propaganda about their perceived threats
to humanity. Also on them are the usual hymnals, as well as books full of
standard hymns and a few racially tinged hymns, probably modified from KKK
'hymns' of racism, to fit the Humanis outlook, which sadly isn't the slightest
bit different. An old stain-glass window sits upon the eastern wall, depicting
a human wearing a knights suit of armour, and standing perched atop the
corpses of various metahumans. Proudly emblazoned upon his shield is the all
too familiar insignia of the Humanis organization, and his long sword drips
heavily of a blackish blood, presumably from his slain enemies, insinuating
that they're so evil in nature that the liquid in their veins is darkened.

to be an old childrens hymn book here, which seems to be mostly covered in
crude drawings of fairly offensive portrayals of metahumans. Good stuff.

   This sturdy wooden pulpit is where Pastor Matthews delivers his fiery
sermons about God's demands for humanity to take up arms against the metahuman
villainy that threatens the earth, and other such hate fueled horsedrek. To
the east is a doorway leading to a place with a large water tank converted
into a wide pool where patrons of the church are baptised.

   A white makeshift wooden pulpit with a swastika carved into it sits in
front of you, which stands proudly in the front of the room. Pews to the left
and right are makeshift benches, wooden planks painted white that are sitting
on top of standard plasticrete cinder blocks. On the benches are leaflets and
tracts full of propaganda by the Humanis policlub, pretty standard stuff about
"The Elven Agenda" and "What Dunkelzahn Was Really About".

Name:	Between the Pews
Desc:$
   They call 'em pews, but they're just make-shift wooden planks sitting on
top of cinderblocks, with hymn books and gospel tracts strewn across them. For
the most part this looks like any old 'non-denominational' church you might
find, except for the racist Humanis propaganda booklets scattered about. Ahead
is a pulpit, and a doorway to the 'baptismal room' where people get dunked in
water. A few spent bullet casings and bloodstains can be seen on the floor, so
while they may claim they're a nonviolent organization, you would have to be
blind not to see they most certainly are.

   A white hallway separates the main part of the church from the outside. On
the walls are various tracts and fliers listing a myriad of bigoted slogans
such as: "WE WERE HERE FIRST, THE DEVIL SPAWN MUST GO", and "GOD LOVES HIS
CREATION - BUT GOD DIDN'T CREATE HIM" on a flier which depicts a red-skinned
Oni with a goatee and horns. Tracts along one of the tables set up here speak
of "The Elven Agenda" and how the devil plans to take over the world with
nations such as Tir Tairngire and Tir Na nOg.

   Before you stands a creaky looking church with a steeple. The wooden double
door has its left half wide open, while the right is shut tightly, which has a

CHURCH IS FOR THE ONE RACE GOD MADE IN HIS IMAGE. NO SUMMONERS OR WITCHES.
PURE HUMANS WITH NO DEVIL POWERS WELCOME. -Pastor John Matthews." A musty
smell from inside the church wafts out into the front 'lawn', which consists
of nothing more than a pock marked half gravel half concrete lot surrounded on
three sides by an old, rusty iron fencework whose stone posts are slightly
crumbled.
