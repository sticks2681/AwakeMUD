Name:	Rose Garden Expressway (NE)
Desc:$
   The Rose Garden Expressway winds around the Rose Garden Arena, a massive
sports complex where the Portland Lords baseball franchise, the Portland
Trailblazers basketball franchise, and the Portland Marchers hurling franchise
all play.  Three massive behemoths of sports arenas sit on the western side of
the highway, dwarfed only by the Rose Garden parking garage.

Desc:$
   Rose Garden Expressway whips around the Rose Garden Sports Complex and ends
at the Broadway Bridge which goes into Northwest Portland.  On the west side
of the expressway is the South Arena, the oldest of the three massive stadiums
in this complex, built a long time ago by Paul Allen, one of the first people
to become supremely rich by the corporation long dead after the Crash of '29
and the Renraku buyouts.

Desc:$
   The Rose Garden Expressway zips past a complex of bus stops and the MAX
light rail station, closer to the Willamette River, where it ends and Broadway
begins, over the bridge and into Northwest Portland. From here you can see the
brilliantly striking Portland skyline, which is the pride of Elven
architecture in this modern age.

Desc:$
   The Broadway Bridge rises high over the Willamette River, the river that
the city of Portland is built around.  The water below looks green and mucky,
and the bridge itself is quite dark and rusty, as if it hasn't been renovated
in about twenty years. Traffic is lined up from bumper to bumper most of the
time, and you hear car horns being activated liberally, and the occasional
sperethiel profanities being shouted out by the drivers.

Name:	Broadway, entering Northwest Portland
Desc:$
   Tall warehouse type buildings from the twentieth century worn from over a
century's worth of rain, patched up from about a centuries worth of half-assed
renovation attempts to just make building codes, make for some very ugly
eyesores. And that is what you see in this particular stretch of the Portland
area.  You see grafitti all over the walls, signs of gang activity, as well as
the usual freaks and tweaks you find in the less well-off portions of any
city.  Even the elven nation has their dregs of society.
   A very ugly warehouse, six stories tall, covered in rust stands northwest
from here.

of here the Greydog Bus Depot, and all around you are tall warehouse and
storage buildings, marred by many a year of torrential downpour. Farther south
you see the tall, shining spires and skyscrapers of Downtown Portland, and a
small club district.

   On the north end of Broadway, between Glisan and Irving, are a hell of alot
of ugly warehouse style buildings.  Some are made of dilapidated brick, and
are covered with graffiti and countless ugly black stains accumulated from
years of acid rain.  Others are just made of metal and look even uglier with
trails of rust all over their exterior.  Ancients graffiti covers the walls,
not even sparing the occasional handbill plastered upon the walls.

from Interstate 5 into Downtown Portland, other than the even more traffic
hampered Highway 405, this road sees a lot of action.  To the south are
several clubs and a restaurant.

Tairngire that treats all races equally, despite pressures from the
government, will choose an ork to work behind the counter as quickly as they
will choose an elf, and will sell you a full course meal for 3 nuyen.  On the
walls are various artworks featuring the homeless, and hobos from many eras
ranging from the 1920's to the 2020's, to today's hapless Tir Tairngire
untouchables.  Many signs are on the walls with political statements
sympathizing with more liberal causes, environmental causes, and homeless
rights.

   A large bulletin board is here at the end of the bar.  Many phone numbers
and notes are pinned to the wall, and graffiti is carved into the board. There
is a long black painted table, with a fire pattern painted along its edges.
Several seats are here, and there is a terminal sitting upon the table, as
well as an RJ-3215 connection for matrix access.

Name:	TT-Bank
Desc:$
   Back in the day, this chain of banks was called US-Bank, but political
upheavals had caused it to become split into two companies, AmericaBank and
TT-Bank.  This outlet of TT-Bank is fully automated, making it one of the few
banks in Tir Tairngire that actually cater to non-elven races, as an ATM
machine can't tell if your ears are pointed or not. There are bullet proof
glass casings protecting the innards of the ATM, as this is the rougher end of
Downtown Portland, and the proprietors know that they could be robbed at any
time.

Desc:$
   Towering wrecks of warehouse buildings surround you on both sides of the
street, covered with graffiti and stains from many decades of torrential rains
and minimal upkeep. Various handbills are plastered upon the walls of the
buildings, advertising for several Tir-based corporations, NERPS, and
musicians coming through town, playing at places such as the Satyricon, the
Cobalt Lounge, and the Paris. One of prominent buildings found here, which has
escaped the wrath of gangers, is the restaurant known as The Cave, which
features orkish cuisine, modified and tamed for elven tastebuds. It has become
fairly popular with the mid-to-high end wageslaves that frequent the area for
a taste of something a bit more barbaric.

Sure its cheap, but you might have to kick the dead body out of the coffin you
rented before there is room to crash out in there.  Roaches scurry about the
walls, and the place smells of sweat and vomit.

Name:	Near a large panoramic window
Desc:$
   This place may be the epitome of slumminess, but the view of Downtown
Portland from here is phenomenal.  A large plate glass window has been
restored and kept clean by the gangers here.  The air is filled with the sound
of screech metal music and yelling of the gangers shacking up here.  Graffiti
covers the support beams between the floor and ceiling.

Before you, you can see the corporate steel and glass towers of Downtown
Portland, including the UBank Tower (long owned by TTBank but still keeping
its original name), Koin Tower, and to the southeast, the Telestrian Habitat.
In the foreground you see the brick structures that make up Old Town, the
portion of Portland you are at the north end of.

Desc:$
   A few couches are lined out here, in the northeastern end of the Ancients
hideout's first floor.  The air is thick with the smell of alcohol and vomit.
You can see a few spent BTL chips strewn about.  Cockroaches are commonplace
here.  The sounds of screech rock fill the air, from a stereo system that
would have cost thousands of nuyen if it weren't stolen.

Name:	A heap of garbage
Desc:$
   It appears that some attempts of tidying up the rest of this floor have
resulted in a large heap of trash shoved into the corner here.  Pieces of old
decayed furniture, old industrial relics, empty pizza cartons, broken
alcoholic beverage bottles and a myriad of other sorts of trash items rise up
to the ceiling.  This will probably never be cleaned out as this hideout
doesn't officially exist, so the Tir Tairngire Waste Management Services do
not service this building.

trilevel bunkbeds with stained mattresses and no sheets.  Upon them, you see
sleeping Ancients gangers and passed out gutterpunks allied with the Ancients
gang.  The room smells of sweat and body odor.  Even elves smell bad when they
don't shower.

   The name "Morkhan" is known even in non-elven circles, not for the

Sperethiel for 'one who fornicates with swine'.  Why the man behind the
counter here would choose that for his name is beyond any sane person's
understanding but he flaunts it with pride.  Morkhan sells a large array of
high grade armor, stolen during gang raids on corporate forces in the
Salish-Sidhe territories.  Morkhan probably has other, more shady sources, but
his lips are sealed.

This intersection has a stoplight, though it doesn't see the cross traffic

   As Broadway closes in on Burnside, generally considered the main street of
Portland proper, traffic piles up, escalating to stop and go levels during
peak traffic hours on weekdays.  Signs, both neon and mundane plasticrete
advertise many services, products, and companies in Sperethiel characters,
which look alot like Kanji when done in neon, and English letters.  The rain
is nearly constant, and the street seems to twinkle with a golden color from
the sodium streetlights used in Downtown Portland.  The sidewalks are done in
brick from Davis Street on south, adding to the ambience of the elven city.

   Broadway meets Couch Street, (pronounced 'kooch') here at an intersection
with no stoplights to manage traffic.  Not that Couch street really sees much
traffic to begin with, other than pedestrians and cars going to the
destinations of little importants upon Couch.  And the nightclubs.  The street
seems to glisten in the glow of the sodium streetlights, as they are covered
in the rain commonplace in Northern Tir Tairngire.

#14664
Name:	Broadway (NW)
Desc:$
   Broadway here is a large parking lot due to the traffic at the intersection
southward, planted between two parking lots.  The parking lot on the east end
of the road belongs to the administrative offices of the Powell's Books and
Information Archives conglomerate, and the parking lot on the west side of the
street belongs to Burger King, a time-honored fast food chain whose Downtown
Portland franchise has become something of a traditional hangout for the
riff-raff of the city.

Name:	Broadway and Burnside (W)
Desc:$
   This major intersection is the home of few car accidents and many traffic
jams.  In fact, at most hours one would say the traffic here is slowed down to
a crawl.  Broadway crosses Burnside and goes into the Southwest downtown
district, and Burnside runs from East to West through most of the city. The
image of this intersection is something like a smaller scale Times Square with
large media signs constantly shovelling trideo commercial content down the
throats of anyone capturing a glimpse, and large Sperethiel neon signs, elvish
pictograms with the splash of color, a surreal image only visible in the Sixth
World sprawl of Portland, Tir Tairngire.

Desc:$
   A bar and grill with a clientele of more than just elves, unlike most
venues in the city of Portland.  The Toadstool is not exactly tres chic, not
exactly upper crust, in fact one would say it was ghetto.  It is, however a
decent place to make contacts within the city of Portland, if you are of a
shadow orientation.  Some graffiti, written in green paint, is scrawled on the
left hand pillar along the entrance archway.

Desc:$
   The cigarette smoke is quite thick here, giving those with low constitution
watering and red eyes.  Some pool tables are lined up here, few functional
enough to support an actual game.  Knife marks and gouges into the felt
surface of the pool tables tends to make a table not function properly.  The
floor is linoleum with big scuffed marks where dried and caked globs of
plaster once held a carpet in place, long since removed.  Orks, trolls,
dwarves, and humans seem to frequent this place far more often than anybody
else, and some candles are mounted on the wall, to give this place an ambience
particular to only this place.  The walls are a dark midnight blue, with a
cornflower blue tone to them.  The ceiling is a black painted plaster, with
various party lights set up every few meters.

at even spaces, one ashtray per seat, cheap aluminum with the Toadstool emblem
embossed on them.  Posters for various liquor companies and brand names are
plastered all about the bar.

Trains regularly coming through here northbound and southbound stop and then

of tires against asphalt, filtered through ten or so meters of plasticrete.
South of here is a parking lot where few people actually park, as it is the
site of the Saturday Market, currently closed due to some governmental red
tape.

    The 60th Street MAX Station is sandwiched between the Tir Tairngire Royal
Hospital and Interstate 84, which fills the air with the loud sound of traffic
at all hours.  The station runs between the two tracks, one eastbound to
Gresham, the other westbound to Downtown Portland.  The air is thick with
petrochem exhaust fumes, and there is litter strewn about.  One would think
elves to be environmentally conscious, but give them a life of convenience and
they are no different than any metatype.

   60th Street climbs high on an overpass over I-84 here, and gives one a good
vantage point of the Big Tir's metropolis, the Portland Metroplex.  Westward,
the skyline of Downtown Portland and the Telestrian Habitat dominate the
scene, after miles of smaller office buildings and light industrial centers.
Eastwards, the scene looks more barren, with smaller buildings, and eventually
Gresham, the pocket barrens between here and the Portland Wall.  An elevator
is here, to connect the road with the MAX station below.

is scratched up with ganger graffiti.  The room smells of urine, as some of

#14707
Name:	Outside the Tir Tairngire Royal Hospital Complex
Desc:$
   A large parking lot is here, with many cars and ambulances parked in neat,
tidy rows.  The tarmac on this parking lot is very well kept, and is a clean
black color.  The Tir Tairngire Royal Hospital is a old, late 20th century
brick building, though is state of the art in its facilities, and is
maintained exceedingly well, to the point to where one might think it was
built recently.  Helicopters buzz off the rooftop where a Helicopter Rescue
Unit makes for snappy recovery of those critically ill or injured.

Name:	The Walkway
Desc:$
   The Walkway is a clean concrete walkway that runs parallel to Stark Street
just south of here, separating the three main buildings of the Tir Royal
hospital.  Just North is the Clinic, which is where probationary citizens,
unknown citizen status, and Gentry Class patients are helped, and eastward is
the Complex, which includes the psychiatric unit and the criminal treatment
unit, and westward is the Hospital, for higher class patrons.

Desc:$
   A rather well kept, but overcrowded clinic with a large waiting room,
packed with people, wishing to be treated for all manner of illnesses and
injuries.  Overworked doctors and interns come in at all hours with people on
stretchers, who are often just filed away in a room while they work triple
shifts to keep up with the inflow of 'lower' class Tir citizens and
non-citizens.

Name:	Gresham MAX Station
Desc:$
   This is the end of the line for the MAX trains, and is in a rather upscale
edge of Gresham. Security often has little reason to be called to this
station, as Gresham sees a form of tranquility not entirely common to the rest
of Portland, save for Royal Hill and a handful of other luxurious portions of
the city. The gang graffiti that often covers most of the walls that separate
the stations from their stops are next to non-existent here in Gresham.

through the west side of downtown Portland. A series of tall corporate office
buildings tower to the east, and an assembly of high-class stores cluster to
the south. The immediate vicinity, though, isn't nearly as respectable. A
strip bar named Mary's and the Broadway Arms hotel both look fairly
disreputable, as does the Stuffer Shack on the corner.

lot of brawls, and the Tir Peace Force is often called in.  The first thing
you see by the door is the bar, which is small, but has everything.  Farther
in is a single stage, a few tables, and in the back some video poker units.
Loud trashy rock music fills the air, and the smell of beer, blood, and
cigarette smoke is thick.

   Burnside runs between 8th Street and Broadway in between two parks, one
small, just south of here with a restroom and fountain, and one large, the
park blocks going northward, ending at Irving at the Tir Tairngire Royal
Postal Station.  Just across the park blocks from here you can see the lights
of Powell's Technical Books, a source of information for anyone wishing to
learn about decking and electronics, or brush up on their skills.  Trees run
through the middle of Park Blocks continuing northward to Irving.  Up
Burnside, you see the road slope past the overpass for Interstate 405, well
beyond the main Powell's Bookstore.   The delectable smell of real high
quality pizza passes your nostrils for a moment, and as you look westward
again, you see the sign for Rocco's Pizza. Neon signs line Burnside in
Sperethiel letters, with non-neon English captions, barely readable
underneath.  One can tell where this culture is headed.

side of the Willamette River.  Eastwards you can see the neighborhoods on the
other side of the river, basking in a nearly constant shadow created by the
mammoth Telestrian Habitat arcology.  Going north up Eighth, that street
creates a narrow lane that runs alongside North Park Blocks, ending at a large
Postal station at Irving.  Westward, Burnside runs past some commercially
zoned buildings with offices upstairs, and storefronts downstairs, as well as
Rocco's Pizza and Powell's Books.

artists lofts, low grade commercial projects and light industrial companies.

   This is the center of it all, behold.  Nerd utopia.  Books, books, books in
every direction.  Advanced TrideoPerl by O'Reilly Books.  Hacking E++ by IDC
Books.  Inside the MPCP by Novatech Publications.  Its all here.  To the south
is a large coffee bar with a wide selection of coffee drinks.  To the north is
the training center, where the famed Tir decker Gargamel can help anyone, from
a buck neophyte to an advanced grid jockey with their questions and skill. For
a fee, of course.  This isn't the place to stir up trouble, either as
Knight-Errant keeps a close eye on the goings-on here, as they are the ones
contracted to the security of this store.  Its all about the information.

Desc:$
   Several plain white tables are laid about at this end of Powell's Technical
Books.  A magazine rack sits at the north end of the room, just before the
cashwrap north of here.  In the rack are a myriad of hacker rags and system
adminstrator magazines, with titles such as "Intrusion Countermeasures
Monthly", "Renraku Windows Illustrated", and "2600".  The coffee smell is in
the air here, creating a calming effect to those whose drug of choice is
caffeine.  The lights are bright, coming from fluorescent lighting above you.

   There are several shelves of books here, as well as pieces of hardware on
top of those shelves, many dating back to the seemingly prehistoric dawn of
computing.  An Altair PC, created before they actually figured out they could
connect a keyboard and monitor to a computer.  An Apple ][e machine.  Still
functional.  A few ancient calculators.  A Sony CT-1 prototype cyberdeck from
the 2030's.  An ancient Pentium III laptop running Linux.  Sitting behind a
table at a chair, intensely engrossed in some hardware related project
involving a mix of cyberdeck parts from Novatech, old Fuchi, and Fairlight
parts is an odd looking elf wearing thick glasses, and staring at the parts he
is working with closely.

Name:	Burnside and Ninth (W)
Desc:$
   Burnside is the heart of Portland, the road that separates Northwest from
Southwest, and Northeast from Southeast.  To the west, the street slopes
upward, as Burnside eventually reaches the West Hills beyond a huge neon sign
that reads "^BVOLVO^n".  Neon signs on each side of the road, and holosigns with
constant movement spashing brandnames on the screen, and services for sale or
rent, in English and Sperethiel, line the roadway.  Farther up the street, you
see a large concrete building on the north side of the street, and a large
pizza restaurant across from the concrete building.  The West Hills create a
huge visible barrier between Portland and the Beaverton/Royal Hill sectors.

Desc:$
   Burnside meets with Tenth here, at a pretty large intersection preceding
the overpass where Burnside runs over Interstate 405.  On the northwest corner
of the street is the entrance to Powell's City of Books, the largest dealer of
hardcover books on the North American west coast.  Its also a good place to
find magical materials of a hermetic or even shamanic bent.  All traditions
are covered in the massive library/store that is Powell's.  The delicious
smell of pizza passes your nostrils, as on the southeastern corner of this
intersection is the entrance to Rocco's Pizza, a pizzeria that is just too
good to die.  They are well known for the 'girth' of their pizza slices, large
enough to fill a troll for a day.

   Several booths line up against the window, which give patrons a view of
Burnside and the entrance to Powell's Books across the street. Retro-new-wave
music plays over the stereo system, adding to the retro-edge ambiance that
this pizza parlor is trying to achieve. Tables sit between the circle of
booths, two total, and usually have nobody seated on them-- just a few copies
of yesterday's paper, and Willamette Week magazines. A counter sits by the
wall, with red pepper and mozzarella cheese for topping on pizzas.

   In front of you is a cashier dressed in a glittery tanktop and tight
shorts, wearing emo style glasses, white with obviously bleached blonde hair
with pink streaks.  She smiles at you in a plastic way as she asks what you
would like, and recommends the day's specials.  Behind her, you see a few
cooks handling pizza dough or carefully removing the finished product from the
ovens.  The cheese bubbles, the toppings sizzle.  Despite the slitchy cashier,
that pizza looks damn good.  A glass case displaying the pizza by the slice is
covered by artwork and labels from local indie rock bands and pirate radio
stations, such as the infamous KBOO, which went underground after Lugh
Surehand came to power.

   Stark Street, going west from here has long been known for the more garish
lifestyles, in fact one might call it a pretty gay place.  Its inhabitants are
colorful, gazing westward, you see quite a few flags with rainbow colors
draped alongside the buildings, with places like "The Jail", "Roxy's",
"Swishy's Tavern", "The Fish Grotto", and of the time-honored "Silverado
Club".  Men wearing tanktops and short jean shorts seem to be awful friendly
to other men wearing tanktops and leather hot pants.  Going south, Broadway
moves on to the corporate sector and Surehand Square.

The staircase smells of soap bubbles, and sticks slightly with a soapy film on

Presley with a saint's halo, in a glowing white rhinestone bell-bottom suit.
Organs accompany the recorded choir.

Thirteenth Street where it ends near the 405 Freeway, you see buildings draped
with ^Rr^Ya^Gi^Bn^Mb^Ro^Yw^n flags, and men wearing very tight clothes and leather hats.  The
'rainbow' stretch of Stark Street ends at Hamburger Mary's, the last stop

friendliness to those of 'alternative' lifestyles.  Rainbow flags are draped
above the entrances to many of the venues along this street, a one-way street
carrying little traffic by car, much traffic by foot.  Men wearing tight
shorts and tank tops walk up and down the street holding hands, women with
crewcuts wearing leathers do the same.  To the west are venues such as
"Roxy's", the "Fish Grotto", "The Jail", and the "Panorama".  You are standing

Sperethiel hang on top of the various storefronts, flashing in many different
radiant colors.  The sidewalks on this side of Broadway are done in brick,
rather than concrete, glistening in the streetlights and neon from the nearly
constant rains that pour onto Portland's streets.

   Southwest Stark and Sixth criss cross here, two small but high traffic
one-way streets, at an intersection with a stoplight.  The stoplights do not
have buttons to press for the "walk" signals to cross on foot, as pedestrian
traffic crosses here constantly.  Northeast is the TTB Tower (Tir Tairngire
Bank), an odd shaped building that was in many ways a forerunner to the
architectural styles of the Sixth World.  Its a sort of ruddy brown marble
color with mirror finished windows that climbs many stories high, putting a
golden cast onto the streets on those rare days when the sun is out.  The
sidewalks are made of brick, not the usual concrete you see elsewhere, adding
to the 'high-class' corporate feel of the Southwest Corporate Sector of the
downtown area.

brown 'marble' colored building with mirrored windows with a golden tint.  The
TTB Tower was a prototype for much of the architecture of the Sixth World, and
is oddly shaped, with a rhombus shaped foundation.  Its brownish pink color
sets the color scheme of many other buildings built during that time, only
other survivor of that age of architecture, though different, is the KON tower
deeper into Southwest.  Tall corporate skyscrapers overshadow you in this
sector, with neon signs in Sperethiel all along the lowest level over the
storefronts at the ground floor.

Name:	Sixth and Everett (NW)
Desc:$
   Sixth street meets with Everett here in a dingy dirty part of town, with
litter fluttering across the streets in the wind, until they find a puddle to
float in.  Graffiti covers every street sign and wall, bright green and blue
colors crisscrossing, with no legibility whatsoever, save for the obvious
"Ancients" seen in the graffiti in a few places.  This is Old Town, home to
dirty old brick buildings that should have been condemned years ago, but still
find use amongst the lower classes as squats and storefronts, as well as the
occasional office building.

Desc:$
   Sixth Street runs here between Glisan and Everett, between two ugly
buildings, one of them holding a squatter rest turned coffin motel called
"Blanchet House", and the other one an old artist loft that has become
something of a crashpad for Ancients gangers.  Up ahead north is the Hellhound
Bus station, carrying people between here and Seattle.  The streets smell of
urine and other things you would rather not imagine.  Wet litter is strewn
about the street, sticking to the sidewalk, damp from the constantly moist
weather.

Desc:$
   Stark Street runs through the northern edge of the Southwest Corporate
sector of Tir Tairngire's capital and largest city.  Southward, a large
skyscraper blocks your sight.  All long the streets of the Corporate sector
are brick sidewalks with brass edges, the occasional water fountain, and neon
signs in Sperethiel, advertising the services at the storefronts of the ground
levels of the tall towers that overshadow you.  The TTB Tower, north of you is
quite tall, one of the first of the modern generation of skyscrapers ever
built, a marble lined steel and glass superstructure that seems to nearly
puncture the sky.

Desc:$
   At the hinterland of the Southwest Corporate District of Tir Tairngire's
largest city and capital, Portland, you stand between a parking garage going
up for several floors, and the TTB tower, headquarters for the Tir Tairngire
National Bank, and Burnside, the main artery of Portland's street traffic, the
heart of the city.  The sounds of traffic fill the air, car horns, and
skidding tires, as even 'noble' elves can be drekheads on the road.  South,
down Fifth is the Corporate Sector, a very densely built district, with marble
and ivy covered postmodern superstructures, a show of hybrid corporate-elven
architectures, with dazzling neon lights on the lowest levels, where
storefronts serve workers for the various corporations welcomed to do business
within the exclusive elven Royal Principality.

structural glass composite walls.  The floors are marble, with a silver vein,

   Three paths, hallways if you will, though rather large to be called that,

A sign, written in a friendly font, both in Sperethiel and English reads,
"Reclaimed water, please do not drink".  South is the main branch of the Tir
Tairngire national bank, through a door at the south end of this lobby, and
westwards is Sixth Street, while eastwards is Fifth.

window instead of crammed in the middle, to get a scenic view of the city as
the train screeches through.  Up near the ceiling are panels with advertising,
none of which readable, save for someone fluent in Sperethiel.  Even then its
of little interest, mostly ads for cellphones and car insurance companies.
