#12000
Name:	At the base of a large hill
Desc:$
   This large hill is located right off of Paradise Lake Road, which extends
out towards the west, and can be spotted even from here as it journeys its way
along northwest and down further south from here into the depths of Redmond.
The area at the base of this hill seems to be used as a makeshift parking lot
for mostly abandoned vehicles, and even then, it is sparsely populated by
anything more than charred, burnt-out husks of random vehicles that had been
stolen and stripped of anything precious before being dumped here. The hill to
the north seems to be just as vehicle unfriendly as the loose gravel lot
itself is.

Name:	Near the top of a large hill
Desc:$
   The top of this hill offers a fairly good view of Redmond as it stretches
off to the east and south, which unfortunately isn't easy on the eyes for the
most part. What lies on the other side of the hill to the north looks far more
interesting, but is hard to make out through the ragged brush of plantlife,
but even from here one can notice the faint glowing haze that hangs in the
air. The smell lingering in the air is about the same as other parts of
Redmond, unpleasant, and on the fringe of burning ones nose hairs to the root.

Name:	Overlooking The Plastic Jungles
Desc:$
   After traversing the peak of the large hill, one is confronted by a very
odd sight. What at first seems to be some sort of utopian paradise tucked away
in the waste of the barrens known as Redmond, is in reality, something much
different. Multiple massive domes of grey bio-plastic dominate the view
beyond, scattered around the landscape along with various plantlife that grows
wildly out of control. Behold, The Plastic Jungles of Redmond, which were
originally built by the mind of a wealthy agriculturist in hopes of yielding
an abundance of viable food sources. At first it seemed successful, but it was
soon proven that the land and soil was too contaminated with pollution,
rendering most of the crops unusable. The crash of 2029 destroyed the fortune
of its designer, and it was left to rot like most of Redmond. It quickly
became a refuge for metahumans who were tossed aside and discriminated against
by the rest of society.

Name:	At the base of a large hill
Desc:$
   Descending down the hill is like descending down into a lost world that
even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have been hard pressed to believe. Flora of
all sorts sprout from the bare soil, and while there appear to be several
concrete pathways splitting off into various directions, a good deal are in
disrepair with roots breaking through their cracks and causing even more
damage to them as they continue to grow unabated. A little off to the
northwest stands the closest agri-dome, partially obscured by the abundance of
tall trees and other multitudes of plants. Another set of paths head off
northeastward into the thicket of a heavy forest.

Name:	A thick forest southeast of Alpha Dome
Desc:$
   An initial treeline covers the cardinal directions here, and in some places
extends inward into a menagerie of wildlife that nearly suffocates the land
here. Plants and trees of various origins, some not even native to this part
of the world, grow wild and unchecked, with only a few foot paths cutting
their way through and out towards other portions of the Plastic Jungles. A
small service road can be spotted occasionally through what little view of the
north isn't completely blocked off by the trees and their thick tangles of
branches.

Name:	Trudging through the forest
Desc:$
   The heavily forested area here continues to trudge its way along, growing
thicker and more dense as it does. Massive trees that aren't normally seen in
this region of the country thrive unexpectedly, having been transplanted in
the Plastic Jungles hay day, and have since made this place their home. The
service road off towards the north somewhere can hardly be seen, and even
then, only fleeting glimpses of it make it through the masses of foliage,
entwined branches and vines.

   Tightly concentrated trees of all sorts of sizes, species and sub-species
dominate the land here on all sides, making passage extremely difficult at
best. Unseen creatures can be heard skittering through the area, but there
doesn't sound like anything much to worry about aside from run of the mill
woodland animals. A small clearing in the woods eventually opens up, and from
first glance it looks to be an old campsite, complete with an old rock lined
fire pit covered in charred ashes and various bits of mostly consumed wood.

Name:	A small gap in the treeline
Desc:$
   A small gap appears here in the treeline, which seems to be the only
footpath in and out of this end of the overgrown area southeast of Alpha dome.
The foliage is heavy and built up against one another to create a natural
barrier of dark green and woodland brown colours, which is spotted by swatches
of brighter green as various plants attempt to make their mark on the land.
The path itself weaves its way down further into the thicker section of
forested area to the south, beyond what little protection the road had to
offer.

The road itself continues to wind along the outer wall of the Alpha Dome,
curling around along to its eastern side. When the wind changes it brings in
an odorous funk from what smells like a bog from an area secluded beyond the
thicket of trees bordering the roads southeastern side.

Desc:$
   Beyond the thicket of foliage that makes up the natural barrier, keeping
this section of the forest away from prying eyes, is a secluded bog. The
marshy land is swamped with water draining out from a large run-off tunnel on
one side of the bog, its access blocked off with a large rusty grate, which
has gotten backed up a little from bits of garbage and other natural debris.
The bog itself teams with the smaller forms of life that call this place home,
but a more important point of reference would be the flattened slivers of
grass and plants on the outer banks of the water, giving the impression that
something quite large makes its home here.

   This part of the service road has certainly seen better days, and at some

southern side of the road work two-fold on stretch, in some places destroying,
while in other places their collection of expanding roots are the only thing
holding the road together, which continues its way along outer wall of Alpha

wall itself rises a few meters straight up from the ground before the dull
grey bio-plastic dome curves up and away towards the north. Among the thicket
of plantlife are scattered bits and pieces of garbage that have piled up over
the years, most of which are low-end soy-snack wrappers and other refuse,
while other pieces look to be more.. organic. As to what exactly they consist
of, its probably better if you didn't know.

Desc:$
   The Alpha Dome outer wall continues along, seperating whats contained
inside from the outside world. This particular pathway looks to be what used
to be the remains of an old paved road, but through the years it has all but
crumbled and is reduced to loose rocks and spotty chunks bordered by plant
growth. The 'road' itself stretches further to the west and seems to encircle
the dome itself, while another breaks off from the main path and heads
southwest into a more heavily forested area, lending credit to the fact that
it was probably once a set of service roads of some kind.

the landscape just about everywhere one looks, poking up from the ground and
from behind bushes and budding flowers. The field continues along west, while
back to the east beyond the trees one can make out the rugged remains of an

   The massive walls of the Alpha Dome stretch skyward, obscuring all but the
view of clouds as far as anything beyond it is concerned. Cracked segments of
pavement seem to have been intentionally pulled up on this stretch, and the
bare ground beneath has seen much growth as far as wild grasses and generic
weeds as concerned. An old car door has been propped up against the wall here,
for some unknown reason, and seems to have been there for quite some time,
considering it has almost been integrated into the landscape by creeping vines
and moss. A peculiar smell wafts in from the west, which is a mixture of
rotten garbage and other unpleasant scents. A make-shift roadblock has been
erected here, completely blocking off all but the most narrow of passage for
vehicles attempting to head further northwest.

Name:	Near a sinkhole, southwest of Alpha Dome
Desc:$
   This area is more sparsely decorated with vegetation than most of the other
areas, which gives a good view of the composted soil that litters the area,
along with the bits and pieces of trash that poke out of the ground. What
looks to be a bone or two can be found here and there, but as to wether they
are animal of (meta)human are a mystery. What remains of them have been
corroded down, but distinct teeth marks a plenty cover their surfaces, lending
a bit of credit to how they got there in the first place. The ground is raised

Name:	Under a massive weeping willow tree
Desc:$
   This area opens up into rough looking meadow, the trees having become
sparse and given way to smaller dried thickets of low reeds and high wild
grasses. Aside from an occasional unhealthy looking bush or two, centered in
the middle of the area is a massive weeping willow tree. Its branches reach
out to keep a good portion of the field shaded around it, but gives an uneasy
feeling to anyone passing under it due to its naturally creepy looking
appearance. There looks to be some sort of wooden and metal catwalk structure
built on the upper section of the willow tree itself, acting as some sort of
guard post.

Desc:$
   The service road here is in pretty good shape, considering that most other
sections of it are horribly mangled and almost reduced to loose gravel and
chunks of pavement, but its surface is still plagued by the occasional
pothole. Graffiti and worn chalk scribblings cover most of whats still intact,
while moss and plant roots threaten to break through what few cracks spiderweb
their way across the road. A massive weeping willow tree can be seen off to
the north, which blocks a portion of the Alpha Dome from view, while off to

conconction that one wouldn't want to take any chance of drinking.

   The ground begins to become soft and generally muddy in consistency,
although the masses of plant roots help hold together the soil. Its marsh-like
appearance is dotted with swatches of of eroded earth and both lush green and
dried husks of plantlife. The northern edge of the area is dominated by the
rim of a sinkhole, which fortunately seems to be draining off some of the
brackish water collecting around the area so it doesn't become completely
covered in water as well.

   This portion of land is best described as a rut, since it dips down and
seems generally inhospitable to most of the plantlife that thrives. The soil
has been overturned in an obvious attempt to make it accept the roots of
flora, but has not seen any improvement in that area in quite some time. Muddy
paths carved from the earth lead off to the north and east, while the
southeast is cut off with a wide thicket of thorny bushes and trees. Another
path wanders off to the south, where a noxious breeze seems to be creeping in
from.

signs of charring, perhaps due to a lightning strike during a bad bout of
weather. The ground is raised slightly to the south before diving down into

Name:	Outside the main gate of Alpha Dome
Desc:$
   The scenery here continues to consist of grey plastic walls and plant life
as far as the eye can see, however, there is one main difference that stands
out among the crowded area. The wall itself gives way to a large set of what
used to be heavy glass panel doors, but have long since been smeared and
covered in unmentionable amounts of filth, as well as several planks of wood
that cover over most of it. Most of the wooden planks have been heavily
sprayed with graffiti, consisting mostly of slogans such as: "^RStay out^N" and
"^GEnter and Die^N". They all more or less explain the very unpleasant things that
will happen to any trespassers who venture inside. A makeshift set of locks
has been constructed with a few chains and a heavy duty padlock, just in the
case the warnings weren't enough to deter anyone brave enough to enter.

vegetation and trees, it offers ample hiding places for some of the more
unsavoury of the Plastic Jungles inhabitants. Several stacks of concrete,
bricks and other rocks have been tossed up against the side of the domes wall
for some reason or another, some of which have spilled down onto the path
itself, making it hard to keep ones footing as they travel along to the
northwest along the wall.

it certainly is unpleasant. An occasional rustling in the thickets of bushes
give the impression of being followed or watched by some unseen creature,
making for a rather uneasy travel.

flattened surface of rock from being exposed to the elements, which make their

around to the north, offering plenty of spots for the small creatures that
call the Plastic Jungles their home refuge from intruders, along with any
other larger, smarter animals, including metahumans.

creeper and ivy vines, making it next to impossible to pass through or climb
over. To the east side of the path, pressed up against the gentle curve of the
Alpha Dome's outer wall, sits an old and beaten up shack, constructed with
what seems to be any and every kind of material available. The slanted roof
and walls consists of warped planks of half rotten wood, along with the
occasional salvaged car door.

   The inside of this beaten down shack looks just as bad as it did outside as

middle of the shack, which seems to be connected via a long set of pipes that
lead out above, acting as a rain water collection system for drinking
purposes.

Name:	Northwest of Alpha Dome
Desc:$
   Cracked sections of layered concrete and cement are all thats left of what
used to be a series of shallow staircases, which would have normally helped
travelers on foot to navigate the enbankment in the ground as it dips down.
Unfortunately, its been reduced to rubble and its easy walk has become a bit
more treacherous, whos pieces of ruggedly chipped and cracked concrete juts up
over itself, making the task of gaining a foothold without slipping quite an
ordeal in itself.

   The wall rises straight up beside you, while a dirty light provides a tiny
bit of illumination for the path. Below the light, and between two massive
piles of cigarette butts and discarded drug paraphenalia, is a heavy steel
door, embedded in the filthy grey concrete base where the drab bioplastic dome
meets the earth. A few rusty cans of spraypaint dot the base, and most places
along this portion of the wall have been covered in graffiti, consisting
mostly of lewd or inappropriate depictions and phrases that probably don't
need repeating.

   The grafitti continues along the concrete substructures wall which holds up
Alpha Dome, mostly consisting of the same lewd and almost childish trash
talking, gang tags and various names of taggers claiming credit. It did,
however, add a bit of colour to the scenery, which was a welcome change for
most, even if it wasn't the most eloquent of an artistic medium. The worn
pathway has been worked relatively smooth in the compacted dirt and occasional
slab of original cement, probably due to the foot traffic it sees.

   The pathway here is in disrepair, to put it lightly. Most portions of the
pathway still consist of their original concrete pourings, but almost all of
them have been cracked and are jutting up at different angled planes. It
almost looks as if something large had come along, and simply began chopping
at the road in random intervals along its length. A few walkway lamps are
bolted to the wall, almost all of which are shattered or broken off from their
fixtures, so they offer little help in the way of illumination.

splits off to an area tucked off behind a combined natural and man-made
barrier, while the roughly cracked and surfaced path heads off towards the
south, along the bend of Alpha Dome's base.

   Tucked away behind makeshift walls of natural materials, as well as piled
up rubble and wrecked vehicle skeletons that have been grown over for quite
some time, is a meeting place of sorts. The cut is lined with old, almost
rusted out fire barrels, some lit, some not, around which are compiled a
series of furnishings that any homeless man would be envious of. Old cars
seats, duct taped beach chairs, old wooden school desks and an assortment of
different colour and models of folding metal chairs. Some of the fire barrels
have been converted into makeshift grills and ovens for cooking purposes, just
in case you want that delicious crude oil residue flavoured barbeque thats all
the rage these days.

   The wall of Alpha Dome looms overhead, as it does everywhere else along
this particular pathway. A small section is protected from the rain by being
built into the substructure itself, which is being taken advantage of by the
locals, as seems to be the theme of the jungles. Old food wrappers, dirty
clothing, bits and pieces of appliances and whatever else can be scrounged
together for making life easier. The pathway continues off on in each
direction, both ends continuing its journey along the domes outer wall.

to hold itself up. Beside the door is a sign that once read "Service Entrance

thoroughly that the original text is almost illegible.

Desc:$
   This rather shoddy little shack, if it could even be called that, consists
of little more than an old rusted sheet of banged up aluminum bolted in place
and held up by metal pipes stuck into the gravel. Apparently all you need is a
roof and some old, raggedy seats torn out of equally shabby vehicles and
tossed around in an erratic manner for lounging purposes. A rain catch seems
to have been pieced together at one point, but now its just in disjointed
pieces. While not particularly a cozy home, it does make a convient, and
fairly well placed post for keeping an eye out for intruders, or any other
undesirables (in other words, you) from wandering around without supervision.

   While normally gates are for keeping most people out of higher class areas,
that certainly doesn't seem to be the reasoning behind this one. Beyond the
roadblock is more of the dreary scenery offered within plain view, which
seemed to remain a constant for the most part. Another constant, would be the
looming domes, the entrance to the closest of which looks to be further up
along its curve as it bends off to the northwest. Past an outcropping of small
yet heavily forested hills to the off to the northeast hide the top of yet
another of these bioplastic monstrosities, hidden away like some long lost
ruin, and certainly looking the part.

bits and pieces of refuse, such as the stripped off remains of vehicles and
roughly hewn blocks of wood from the surrounding forests.

dome itself pressing the road closer to a natural barricade of the raised
woodland growing wildly to the east. The road itself is in pretty good
condition, if you overlook the occasional spare tire laying around, and the
lines drawn with bullets across its disheveled surface. The road continues
north towards what appears to be some sort of roadblock set up by the locals.

Desc:$
   Unlike a more common, healthy variety, the short stalks of stunted wheat
barely come up to your waist here. The frequent black spot and occasional
uzing pustule does not look healthy to eat, but at least somebody is trying to
bring life back to this hellhole.

Name:	Atop the catwalks of the weeping willow
Desc:$
   The catwalk itself consists only of a few half-rotten and partially
water-logged planks of wood with multitudes of old rusty nails hammered into
the main body of the tree itself. The rope ladder leads back down below, while
off to most sides one is offered a good view of the Plastic Jungles. Alpha
Dome in all its glory stands to the northeast, making it hard to see whatever
it is that lays beyond it, although if one looks hard enough they can make out
the plastic curves of the Beta Dome beyond it. A large lake of pollutants and
sludge is nearby to the northwest, whos fumes trickle up into the air as
ominous looking bubbles boil up from its depths. Off to the southwest, between
the tree branches and other foliage, one can make out Lake Paradise Road,
which leads in and out of the jungles.

Name:	A Shack
Desc:$
   The interior of this shack is poorly lit, causing you to pause just a
moment while your eyes adjust. Once they do, you can see dozens of crates
scattered around the room. They bear a wide variety of food markings, many of
which were originally destined for much more "exclusive" establishments.
   A few groups of crates - one large, two smaller - appear to have been set
up as makeshift tables. Towards the back, a folding table has been set up with
a collection of Sterno(tm) stoves and electric hotplates.

Desc:$
   This tiny building looks like something out of a science fiction movie - it
appears to be perfectly hemispherical, with counters and cabinets and a pair
of beds built directly into the walls. The partially transparent roof,
starting half way up the wall, lets in light filtered twice from above, giving
the interior a warm, orange glow.

doesn't make things much easier, since its seen all sorts of weather and is in

Name:	A Blue Plastic Bubble
Desc:$
   This small building looks like something out of a science fiction movie -
it appears to be perfectly hemispherical, with counters, sinks, and an
operating table built directly into the walls. The partially transparent roof,
starting about three-quarters the way up the wall, lets in light filtered
twice from above, giving the interior a cool, blue glow.

   The interior of this large cylindrical tank is like a techno-fetishest
version of Alice heading down the rabbit hole to wonderland. Computer
terminals ring the walls, shedding thier flickering, multi-colored light
across the walls. Stuffed into every available space between the mighty
machines are rolls of sleeping pads, boxes of food, and jugs of fresh, clean
water.

Name:	A Pre-Fabricated Housing Unit
Desc:$
   This appartment is actually a prefabricated housing unit, originally
intended for deployment on military operations. All of the furniture and
appliances - bed, couch, stove, sink, and shower - are attached to the walls;
many of them even fold up to provide more floor room.
   Unfortunately, this development is missing two things to make this modern
engineering marvel functional - power and running water. Combined with the
stench of rat droppings and mold, this place isn't as spartanly appealing as
it might otherwise be.

stench of rat droppings and mold, this place isn't as spartanly appealing as
it might otherwise be.

   This appartment is actually a prefabricated housing unit, originally
intended for deployment on military operations. All of the furniture and
appliances - bed, couch, stove, sink, and shower - are attached to the walls;
many of them even fold up to provide more floor room.

Desc:$
   Over a dozen prefab housing units appear to be crammed into this dome. The
only illumination in here comes through the door behind you; the dome surface
above you appears to have been set to its polarized, light-blocking state
whenever it last had power. And of course, without power, there are no working
lights inside either.

Name:	A Lake of Sludge
Desc:$
   The contents of the lake itself can no longer even be described as polluted
water, since there was practically no water to speak of aside from the
occasional run-off from rain. Toxins and pollutants seeping from the soil have
collected into this large pool and turned it into a corrosive pit of death.
Organic and non-organic material alike is consumed by its contents like a
horrid beast whos hunger cannot be satisfied. Flesh and sinew are the first to
go, quickly being devoured by the powerful acidic nature of the pool,
rendering bodies into skeletons within mere moments. The bones themselves and
metallic equipment are rendered down within hours, leaving nothing in its wake
aside from an occasional bubbling of fumes as they're broken down.

Name:	At a roadblock and guard post
Desc:$
   A large hill dominates the eastside side of this turn increasingly narrow
portion of road, with its other side is bordered by masses of trees and
plantlife that have grown into the fencing itself, becoming a natural barrier
of sorts. The road eventually terminates in a small circular portion of
pavement, which stands before an old guard post of sorts thats way past its
prime. The shack itself is covered in peeling paint, with rust eagerly taking
its place, with its door completely missing along with the glass of its single
slender window. The post itself is there to guard a large rolling chainlink
security fence that has been reinforced with just about anything on hand, and
makes for a fairly good roadblock.
