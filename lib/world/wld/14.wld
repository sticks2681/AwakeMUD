Desc:$
   This is a long, narrow room; along one wall a waist-height counter is
mounted beneath a long mirror framed with 40-watt lightbulbs and lined with
folding metal chairs. A vast clutter of makeup palettes, jars of cold cream,
brushes, wigs and masks as well as cheap and glittery trinkets, scarves cover
the available surface. Tall lockers squeeze together along the other wall,
spilling forth every imaginable article of clothing in every style conceived.

Name:	Entrance to Urban Underground
Desc:$
   And here it is the Urban Underground known for two things: great retro
urban wear and the home of the Trogs, the enforcers around these parts. The
ceiling of the place is of course quite high and it isn't unusual to see
pimps, gangers of all sorts, drug dealers and other high-rollers frequenting
the establishment. right now Public Enemy's "Kevorkian" can be heard blasting
over the expensive sound system.

Name:	The Urban Underground
Desc:$
   From outside it seemed that the building was ready to collapse but now
indoors it seems quite sturdy with steel supports holding up a mirrored
ceiling that shows rows of clothing and music as well as the shined onyx
floor. The walls have been made out of obsidian so that it gives one the feel
of being in some strange volcanic cave. You finally reach the counter where a
huge Wendigo in Trogs colors waits to sell you things you don't need.

   You walk into an office and come face to face with one of the largest
fucking trolls you have seen in your life. At a enormous 12 feet tall with a
shoulderwidth that makes many doors impassable something tells you that you
don't want to tangle with this bastard. The office itself is fairly well taken
care of and there is a desc with screens showing multiple security camera
angles on it as well as what appears to be a weapons locker in the back of the
office.

computer and bright red Oni male who sits behind the desk waiting to help you.

   The deeper you go into the Night Side the more you realize that the Ghouls,
Night-Ones, and Vampires near you don't seem to be attacking you or even
glaring at you threateningly. Most are going about their business and leaving
you alone. Ghoul gangers are a slight problem here but the Night-One children
playing stick ball on this street don't seem to mind all the HMHVV infected
people around them. Slight lighting is given off by some sore of luminiscient
moss on the ground around here. It creates a pretty cool affect as it casts a
green glow on everything.

   You've reached the end of the tiny Night Side community here after passing
many of the crumbling buildings inhabited by Wendigos, Night-Ones, Vampires,
Banshees, Ghouls and other creatures which prefer darkness you find yourself
next to a spotless black and red home made from brick. A neatly drawn mural o
n the side of the home shows a scene of famous Meta-Rights supporting dragons.
To get a better look at the art you'd need to get closer.

Name:	The Dragon Mural
Desc:$
   A project Greg the Wendigo worked on for years is before you. It is a
expertly done mural showing five different dragons. The first and largest
dragon shown is the Great Western Dragon Dunkelzahn flying through the air
with the great dragon Hestaby curled beneath him with the slightest bit of
what could be a grin on her face. Aden the Sirrush responsible for many
Anti-Jihad forces in the Middle East stands here on his hind legs waving his
front ones in the air defiantly. Hualpa the Feathered Serpent is painted in a
way so that it looks as if he was flying straight at you his mouth open and
the venom sacks for his dual pair of fangs visible. Rhonabwy sets off to the
side in a position that looks like he is stretching.  He also is showing off
his huge wing span so impressive in western dragons. All of the dragons here
have been painted expertly which suprises most since Greg the Wendigo is
traditionally thought of as an idiotic beast. Theres a backyard just off to
the side here.

Name:	The Garden
Desc:$
    hole in the ceiling of the underground allows light to stream in from
above which allows Greg to do some gardening as well as giving his pet goat
some sunlight. Greg of course is only able to do the garden work at night but
it doesn't really matter to him. He currently is growing a wide variety of
flowers and due to the large size and brilliance of them he is apparently
doing a very good job. His pet goat Billy stands off to the side munching on
hay out of a wooden trough Greg made for the goat himself. At first that may
not seem like a big deal but after a moment you realize that a Wendigo like
Greg was actually doing some potentially life threatening stuff by working
with wood. A beautiful Koi pond sits just to the left of the flower garden
where a dozen or so albino Koi swim about peacefully in the dark where they
are away from the sunlight that nurtures Greg's garden but would kill him.

   Greg keeps his food here which happens to be cows. He gives them minimal
creature comforts by just tying them up and throwing hay to them. He usually
goes through three cows on a good month but up to seven on a month where he
has had to do alot of magic or anything else exhausting him. Three cows are
currently tied up munching on their food and pooping in their water in usual
stupid cow fashion.

there and you can see the living room just north of here.

to the old oven and wood stove this is probably the noisiest place in the
home. The noise almost causes you to not notice the trap door which leads down

clogging up the shower drain and a pile of brillo pads are stacked in the
garbage with blood stains on them. The porcelain of both the shower and sink
is stained with blood and the Toilet shows some wear as well. The mirror is
kept clean yet why a Wendigo would want a mirror is unknown. The bathroom
looks relatively normal untill you notice the grinder on the edge of the
counter right above the garbage. Your best guess is that Greg uses this for
sharpening his claws.
