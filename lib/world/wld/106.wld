#10600
Name:	The Hinterlands of Tir Tairngire
Desc:$
   You are floating over what appears to be a vast high desert, with cool
winds, great cirrus cloud formations overhead and a sparse scrub vegetation on
the land.  Below you is a highway, very large, running through the
hinterlands, with much traffic of all varieties.  To your distant west is a
great keep covered with ivy and greenery.

#10601
Name:	The Borderlands
Desc:$
   Just passing through the Intersection of Intersections, the GTG for North
America, you enter a vast desert, a high desert with long highland flats of
shrubs and scrub.  A highway coming from the Interchange of Interchanges, in
the distant east (though you could get there in a nanosecond), runs below
across this great expanse of dry highlands.

Name:	At the foot of the Keep
Desc:$
   This great keep is covered with ivy, and its walls are made of stone,
extending up to the cirrus-lined skies.  A highway ends abruptly at the gates,
where guardsmen busily check the identification of every passer through, and
the signature on every packet that comes in and out of these gates.  Behind
the walls you can see great trees that hang over the walls.

#10603
Name:	A Forested Path
Desc:$
   A wide path seems very narrow here, dwarfed by the mighty forests that
stand above.  Great virgin growths of redwoods and pine, fir, and oak climb
mind-numbingly high, covering the whole sky in a thick canopy.  The path is
made of dirt, and carries many travellers along their way through the Regional
Telecommunications Grid for Tir Tairngire.

Name:	Lost in the Forest
Desc:$
   The forest is infinitely thick and complex with its many deer trails and
twists and turns where large clusters of undergrowth and huge branches stop
your passage.
