Name:	FREE ROOM
Desc:$
   A thin corridor leading towards a t-junction. The white paint on the walls
is sickly and crackling with age. Water stains mar the skirting boards and the
faint scuttling of rats can be heard from above.

Name:	A carpark
Desc:$
   This massive expanse of bitumen looks to be quite old. Faded white lines
mark spaces for cars and a few thinner spaces for motorbikes. A bright blue
neon sign hangs on a building leading to this carpark that reads 'Pilgrims'.

Name:	The entrance to Pilgrims
Desc:$
   The soft wood finish of the double swinging doors makes you feel as if you
should be wearing a six-gun somewhere on you, and if you are your hand should
be hovering over it and ready to draw.  Inside you can hear erratic piano
music, accompanied by a slow strumming guitar.

Name:	The inside of Pilgrims
Desc:$
   Soft country music plays from one side of the room where a small stage is.
An old Ork strums his guitar gently and croons out a song about how his lover
ran away with his best friend, his dog died and how broken his heart is. He's
accompanied by an Elf slumped at a piano, tapping away without much enthusiasm
and a Dwarf sawing at a violin. Two 8-ball tables sit in wait for someone to
use them. The felt is worn is some places, but not enough to see through. And
the paint is worn away so much that the lines have been re-drawn with chalk.

Here on the wall is a golden-framed picture of Sam Elliot. His large bushy
moustache hangs over his mouth like he's plotting something mischievous. A
large ten-gallon cowboy hat rests on his head proudly.

Name:	The bar
Desc:$
   A long wooden bar stands here with a single man behind it. Lines of dusty
bottles of various whiskeys and a few bottles of wine are stacked neatly on
shelves above the bar. The place seems very old fashioned, and the chairs
creak when people sit on them.
