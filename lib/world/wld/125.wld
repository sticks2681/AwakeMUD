Name:	Entrance to the Docks
Desc:$
   You are standing at the entrance to the Docks. In the distance you can see
quite a few ships docked along the piers. There is a scent of dead fish in the
air mixing with the salty smell of the ocean.

   You're in the middle of a semi kept-up tackle shop. The walls here and many
shelves have hundreds of different baits. Apparently many people still enjoy
fishing around here. It smells heavily of fish in here, even more so than
outside.

   As you walk farther along the docks you notice less and less graffiti left
by the gangs around here. Apparently the docks aren't all that important to
them. There are many shops and boats to the east and west, and the ferry
loading platform seems to be located west of here if the signs are to be
trusted. There is also a pier that extends northward out over the waterfront.

   Here you notice that tourists are becoming more and more scarce. The only
people that you really see are workers. The shops that you once thought you
saw wern't shops at all. You now see that they all seem to be warehouses. A
few rusted out signs, ravaged by the salt water, point off towards the north,
indicating the path to the loading platform for the ferry.

pier, fishing, that you'd expect due to the size of the tackle shop.

From here you can see that there is a boat docked on the next pier though you

   As you walk out on the pier you notice a cool breeze that you don't get to
feel further in because of all of the buildings and warehouses in the way. You
can see about five piers off in the distance to the east and one more to the
west.

on the waters but there is the occasional boat or two that comes in.

   Here you can clearly see the remaining 2 things of value off this way...the
dock and the warehouse. There is a boat docked at the dock but you can't read
the name of it because of all of the rust and barnicles on the hull.
   The warehouse looks like most of the others, being worn down and all but
you never know what you might find inside.

   Here's the split to go either to the warehouse or the rusty boat. Off to
the east is the whole rest of the docks. You can't see what all exactly lies
off in that direction though. You do smell a lot of what goes on here though.

   You're standing right outside the Hangin' Tough club. There's some drunken
passers-by that pass you as you kinda make your way through the trash and crap
on the ground. There also seems to be no bouncer for the club, on the outside
at least.

   Now you're almost at the last part of the docks. There's only one more pier
off in this direction. It looks to be used to dock some very large ships. Off
to the west there is the sounds of the Hangin' Tough club that might be a nice
place hang out.

      Here is the last dock. There is nothing further along to the east due to
rough rocky areas and some small buildings. The view of the beach from here is
incredible. You'll have to remember to bring a date here sometime.

   Here is where you board the ferry that travels between here and Tacoma.
There are actually many places where you can board all along this dock since
this is a big boat but this is the most commonly used one.

   Here is another place to board the ferry when it does stop by. At the
moment the ferry rides aren't to popular with people in this area so the boat
stops by very rarly. There isn't much activity on the water right now either.

   There aren't any more places that will let you board the ferry except on
the next pier to the west. There are two places on each dock where you are
able to board. Mostly only the main sections are for passangers though.

   From here you can see pretty much as well as any other place on this pier.
The Royal Mist to the west, the large port docks to the east, the many shops
to the south, and the kinda blue color of the ocean to the north. Ahh...isn't
this great. To your immediate right, a small pier breaks off from the main and
leads you towards a small ferry.

   This pier has a small boat docked on it. Looking at it's hull you see the
name of it. Royal Myst. It appears to be in pretty good condition but with
boats you can never know for sure until you hop aboard. It also looks like
from here is the only place to board or get off of the boat.

   Here is the stern of the boat and because it's there you can't see what's
past it. The pier extends further north still. It seems that larger boats can
dock here too. You also started to notice that because of the distance between
them.

There are three piers out to the east that stick out almost as far as this

   Here you can board the rusty boat. Actually you're not sure if it's a safe
thing to do, it looks like the rust and aging of this boat has made it's deck
and hull very weak. Off to the south and east a bit are some more warehouses.

   The rusty boat is just to the east of you right now. You have to go a

the far distance south is that warehouse that you had seen earlier.

   This just seems to be a common junk shop, or what most people like to call
antiques. One thing that catches your eye is one of those things with the
steel balls that clack together...like in the doctor's offices.

   Here like most of the rest of the room are more crates...kinda getting old
huh. There's not as many here but there are a few. Off to the west there is a
door that you can barly see due to the ammount of things in the way, where
could it go...

   Now you can see what those guys were cheering about. This section of the
club is obviously a strip club. There are nude dancers all over the place and
they're quite beautiful too. You can still hear the band from upstairs from
here too.

heard about from the old times. There's a lookout post at the top that you
seem to remember being called the crows nest.

that are just out of date. They seem out of time, like they shouldn't even be

captains wheel to keep the boat on course. It's made of what looks to be solid
brass and is pretty polished up. Looks like the owner took good care of his
ship.

ocean, which continues on for thousands of miles, far beyond your sight.  The
winds blow a salty breeze in from the Pacific Ocean, and waves crash on the
shore.

taking passengers and cargo to the Tacoma area to the south.  On the western

to Seattle, one can see the Pacific Ocean in all of its quiet, yet powerful
glory.  The skyline of Seattle is quite visible on this ferry no matter where
on its journey it is, the skyscrapers dominate the northeastern sky.
