Name:	At the Courtyard of Novatech Incorporated
Desc:$
   A grassy lawn decorated with trees and flowers leads towards a plaza
dwarfed by an enormous skyscraper. The ^Lblack marble^N corporate monolith bears
the Novatech Incorporated logo on the side of the building. Business
executives and scientists enter and exit the building in a seemingly endless
stream of wage slaves. A fountain shaped like the Novatech Star icon is in
front of the main entrance, spraying water into the air.

Name:	In the Lobby of the Seattle Novatech Building
Desc:$
   Holographic projections decorate the interior of the lobby, expressing
messages of approval for Novatech and its many products. A multilingual
automated greeting message plays at the entrance of the building, welcoming
visitors from across the globe in their native languages. Black marble
interior and marble pilasters supporting the building give the building a
corporate look. Security cameras, while made to look inconspicuous and small,
capture your every movement in this building. A circular counter sits in the
center of the lobby, where charming young Novatech receptionists can assist
the guests.

Name:	Superhuman Inc. Cyberware Studio
Desc:$
   This cyberware studio is certainly much different from the plain, corporate
look in the rest of the building. The walls are lined with covers of various
Marvel comic books, creating a bright, colorful room decorated with superhuman
heroes. Patients awaiting their operations can't help but stare at the walls,
wondering if they end up like those glamorous superheroes after their
cyberware installations.

Name:	Chuck's All-American Diner
Desc:$
   This diner has a post-WWII, 1950's theme. Waitresses zoom around the diner
in rollerskates, and restored jukeboxes are positioned around the diner,
cranking out oldies tunes. An uplifting restaurant, designed to promote
everything that makes (made) America great.

      An uncomfortable breeze is constantly blowing against your face as you
navigate through the ventilation system. With guard drones and walls that seem
to get smaller the longer you spend in here, this isn't exactly the sort of
place you'd want to bring a date to. The vent below leads into a private
conference room of some sort.
