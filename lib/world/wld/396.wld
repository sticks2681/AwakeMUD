Name:	The Gothic Ballroom
Desc:$
   Sandstone, gothic arches sweep up to three stories in height along the
walls, forming corridors along the outside of the room's boundaries.  Light
pours in from all sides of the hall through arched, delicately wrought stained
glass windows that depict the various happenings in the Awakened Worlds at
that moment.  They shift with each nuance that occurs, magically.  The floor
is inlaid with golden streaked pink marble.  Upon the dais at the far reaches
of the hall, a curtain shrouded bed dominates the room.

Desc:$
   On the corner of two major thoroughfares stands a non-descript, squat brick
building.  The windows are blacked out and barred.  All of the entrances have
sophisticated entry systems and what looks to be a SOTA security system
watching all areas of the property.

Name:	A dark room with infrared lighting
Desc:$
   This room is dark with blacked out and barred windows.  It is quite bare,
and spotlighted with the dusky glare of infrared track lighting.  There is a
hulking desk sitting caddy-corner against the northeast side of the room.
This place is so dusty it almost looks abandoned.  If one peers into the dark
recesses of the room, it would reveal that there are lots of security cameras
and automatic weapons pointed at the room from the upper reaches of the wall.
There is a blacked doorway leading further into the Nightcrawlers lair to the
north and the street entrance to the south.

back-lit with flickering lighting matching the primal beats thumping from
concealed speakers.  There is little-to-no elbow room as everyone wants to see
and be seen with the most lovely habitues in all of the Sprawl.  If you care
to take a closer look, you will notice that the populace is comprised of young
people of Asian descent.

   A busy room packed with shelves full of hardware.  All surfaces messily
drip with wires and hard casings of already built decks and hardware stacked
haphazardly.  There is a workbench littered with tools of the trade.  A
rackmount computer, a microtronics workshop, sloppy piles of optical chips, an
array of chip cookers and several boxes of parts.  The floor seems to not been
swept in many years.  In one corner, there is an open file cabinet overflowing
with paper.  A lone barred window lets in minimal light from high on the wall.

   The room widens into a very large space where the throng congregates to
meet new contacts while drinking away their frustrations in an attempt to
arouse excitement in their otherwise mediocre lives.  The actual bar is large
black lacquer with heavy stainless steel rails polished to a mirror's shine.
The thick bartop is inlaid marble in a psychedelic, twisting chessboard
pattern.  The walls and ceiling are painted matte black and are covered with
mirrors of all sizes and shapes where the narcissists that frequent the club
watch themselves with hooded eyes.  The barstools are upholstered in the same
checkerboard pattern and behind the bar are racks upon racks of bottles and
glasses ready to serve the needs of the masses.

the walls and also the door of the room.  From the middle of the ceiling hangs
a white circular track from which water falls like rain into a matching
circular wall on the floor, giving ambiance and further soundproofing to the
discussions taking place in here.  A low, round black marble table sits in the
midst of the rain chamber with large, black suede pillow seats meticulously
arranged around it.

desk is asymmetrical and painted in the same dizzying checkerboard pattern as

strange looking chair upholstered in black and white sits behind it.

dominates the far wall, the chair and gavel hang high over everyone's head.
Next to the judge is the "stand" and the administrative area for the bailiff

Name:	The Italiano Dancefloor
Desc:$
   Though the lighting is low, the room has a very warm glow to it because of
the wood decor.  Spotlights streak throughout the room, lighting up the
dancefloor along with strips of tracklighting along the edges of the room. A
large, half-circular raised stage spans the back of the club where the band
stands, playing soulful and sexy Italian music for the multitudes.  Flashily
dressed folk dance dramatically to the songs.  Most of them are of Italian
descent.

Desc:$
   This smaller, reserved dining area is decorated in much the same way as the
bistro, but it has wine colored drapery hanging decoratively from the four
corners of the room and a large mural on both the north and south wall
depicting a vineyard estate nestled in a green valley.  On the western wall
burns a screened fire in a beautifully sculptured mantle.  A long dining table
dominates the room with high-back chairs tucked underneath.

   Heavy, hand-cut stone walls tower over the area to a height of seven and a
half meters.  Here, where the gigantic iron gates stand to bar entry, the wall
curves in to allow area for cars to pause when entering and exiting the
heavily traversed street to the south.  A box stands out from the wall,
combination vid and code allows vehicles to pass through unmolested.  Sentry
guns flank the walls along with live feed cameras to unload upon those who
dare to trespass.

Name:	The Courtyard Outside the KE Academy
Desc:$
   A huge, circular drive swoops around from the Academy to the entry gates.
The academy itself is made of the same hand-cut sandstone that the huge wall
that surrounds the grounds is.  It is five stories of striking architechtural
design.  The windows are paned in wrought iron and the roof is peaked in
copper plates.  Bright green varigated ivy lends charm to the building,
crawling unmolested up the facade.  Behind the building, the grounds extend
into more lawn and a forest.  Outbuildings that mimic the larger building's
style dot the landscape.

Desc:$
   This huge space is a bustle of activity from people flowing to and from
business at the academy.  Large stainless steel scanners crowd hulk-like at
the door.  Everyone passing through the doors must pass through them.  They
ensure that nothing questionable enters or leaves the Academy.  Four guards
flank the machine to certify that nothing goes awry.  Trophies line the walls
from various contests the Academy participates in.  In the middle of the floor
is a large half circle granite desk for the receptionist.  The hallway extends
to the east and west and steel elevator doors open and close smoothly at the
north.  Two revolving doors stand at the northeast and northwest corners.  A
hint of the lawn can be seen stretching forth thru the glass.

Directly to the east is a huge building housing the obstacle course and to the
west is the garage.  Many people bustle around this area.  Some spill out of
the glass revolving doors to the southeast and southwest from the entrance
hall of the academy.  To the south, one can watch the shining stainless steel

black hazmat sign painted on the side.  On the eastern wall is bolted a white
laquered and locked medicine cabinet.

   The first room to the tactical training course is a veritable armory.  This
is where the recruits gear up to enter the possibly dangerous environs to the
east.  The room is pretty spacious with tables of gear laid out upon it.
Instructors pace the room, waiting with baited breath for the training mission
to commence.

Desc:$
   This garage is an immense metal structure with a black painted concrete
floor.  Huge hydrolic lifts hold vehicles up in the air so that they can be
tweaked.  The building is a riot of activity, drones and KE riggers flit from
vehicle to vehicle to assess work loads and fiddle with the machines.  Huge
diagnostic mechanisms squat next to row upon row of work benches and tool
boxes.  The larger wrenches and tools hang neatly on the peg board lining the
far wall.

   The hemlock trees crowd the thickly covered forest floor here and tower to
amazing heights over your head.  The branches of the canopy are so entwined,
they block out most light, leaving the forest in a perpetual state of
darkness.  It is very cool here and the smell of rich vegetation and rotting
leaves permeates the air.

   The acidic smell of chlorine assaults the nostrils upon entering this room.
It is a smell that one grows accustomed to as they spend more time around it.
A glistening blue, olympic sized pool is layed out here, partitioned into lap
lanes and enclosed in tall walls of concrete with a glass ceiling.  Sounds
rebound off the surfaces of this room in amplification.  There are platforms
looming over the rippling water for diving and a few lifeguard chairs that
flank the walls of the pool.  A jaccuzzi bubbles hotly against the southern
wall next to a bank of hothouse windows draped in climbing ivy and other
ferns.

   This unisex, communal locker room is laid out with all the lockers and
benches along the walls of the space, leaving the showering area and toilets
to set in the middle of the room.  The lockers are painted bright red with a
hook for a personal padlock on the opening latch.  The benches are wood
stained black on metal poles.  The tiling on the floor is bright, clinical
white.  Drains dot the sloping floor in many places.  Chest high (on a human)
are where the shower stalls are built to with rain spout shower heads rising
up from the tile structure.  The toilet stalls are full length boxes of metal
that squat in two sets of three facing each other to the east of the showers.
Into the wall behind the toilets is set a large sauna for your steaming
pleasure.

   The walls stretch forth in the satiny shine of brushed steel, bisected by
blue plastic wall bumpers.  Windows glint at even paces to the south and west,
looking out upon the front courtyard.  Employees and recruits traipse the
corridor purposefully as cameras scope the passerby with lifeless eyes.  The
grey-blue carpet lining the floor is tightly woven, but springy to tread upon.
To the north is a door with a plate reading "The Head".

   This administrator's hobbies are horribly obvious with one step into the
room.  Though the walls are paneled in understated woods and the window
covered with tri-fold wooden blinds, the walls and nearly every surface in the
room are mounted with hunting trophies.  He even has some of the paranormal
animals on display here.  There is a large electric fireplace crackling with
warmth on the east wall.  It's mantle too is a display case for his smaller
conquests.

   The walls stretch forth in creamy linen wallpaper, bisected by warm, wooden

   Towering, shiny black walls meet a slick, black marble tiled floor.  This

office suite does little to warm the starkness of the room.  The windows that

Because the window covered walls of the building allow for natural light to

secretary and phone operator behind a semi-circle, high desk.  Before the desk
are sprawling couches and snack tables that serve as the waiting area and
coffee room.

   Tall ceilings of bright white arch down this long corridor.  Benches and
the occasional potted plant stretch down the middle of the causeway.  This
corridor is tiled in bright, sunlight yellow up to the middle of the walls.
To the north is a storefront shining with big glass windows and millions of
shiny hair accessories lining the walls to the ceiling.  To the south is a
columned storefront with shuttered doors and a dark entry way.  From the looks
of it, you guess that it is a clothing store of some kind.

   This compact store is claustrophobic, packed with hair accessories from
floor to ceiling and on a maze of display cases over the floor space.  There
are thousands of mirrors tilted to different heights and lengths tucked into
the displays.  The bright lights overhead plus the mirrored surfaces make for
a very well lit and glittering store.  The exit to the East Wing of Auburn

   This dark lair of a store is highlighted with bright spotlights to specific
displays.  It brightens that one area and leaves the remainder of the area in
a smoky grey light.  The clothes filling the racks and walls are mostly in the
grunge and skater style.  There is a shoe display against the far wall near
the cashwrap.  The darkened doorway to the north leads back out into the mall.

   The sound of a multitude of informative, looping advertisements for the

you walk into the store.  The displays are a dizzying array of goods that will
do more than furnish your needs in the kitchen and bathroom.  The floor and
walls are painted a cheery yellow color with a salmon red accent.  A small
cashwrap sits caddy-corner in the back of the store and to the south is the
escape from over-stimulation into the mall corridor.

black counter stretches across the back of the store with a single sales woman
posted behind it putting clothes back on hangers.

   This open floor furniture store is set up into a myriad of floorplan
combinations.  One can peruse from one setting to the next from living rooms
and dining rooms to bathrooms, bedrooms and kitchens, pausing to test out the
comfort and quality of each piece.  There is a slow moving people-mover
winding along the arrangements for ease of travel throughout the store.

Desc:$
   This store obviously caters to the shadowrunning wannabe.  Large
flatscreens tilt down from the ceiling looping news clips of infamous
shadowrun activity to inspire further idolization in the store's patrons.
Smoky display cases give the customers a peek at the merchandise, but it is
rare that they are allowed to handle the goods before purchase. The interior
is decorated in shades of black and grey.  The heavily gated exit to the north
leads back into the bright hallway of the mall.

settings lay gracefully over velvet throats and wrists with polished stones
and gleaming gems winking at the passerby.  A small, nondescript cashwrap is
tucked in the corner in front of a door to the backroom.  Standing mirrors

   A gaily lit archway attempts to draw patrons by way of appealing to their
rumbling bellies with intriguing scents of pizza and chicken wafting from the
vaulted ceiling.  To the east is a counter with a pizza pie hanging over it.
Looking west, one would see a cartoon chicken grinning madly from it's perch
over the counter and to the south a delicious sundae floating in holo over the
cashwrap and glass display case.  Heading north would lead away from the food
court back into the third floor of the mall.

people lean over pool tables with the neat click of two billiard balls, the

mah jongg tiles or bending minds at a board of chess or backgammon.

   A large cherry wood desk is set directly in the middle of the floor on a
shaggy white rug that sprawls over blond hardwood floors.  A tall, mesh desk
chair swivels behind the desk and at even intervals around the room are tall,
floor standing vases with fresh flowers sprouting from the tops.  On the wall,
alternating between the vases are elaborate scrolls hanging from floor to
ceiling with Japanese calligraphy on them.  A few gold wire chairs with fluffy
white cushions fan out before the desk for guests to sit on.  Soft, ambiance
music floats from hidden speakers in the walls to resonate in the room.
Behind the desk are two huge, tinted windows covered with white roman shades
and between them is an impressive wall fountain of water running over rippling
slate.

Name:	SCF Kitchen
Desc:$
   This room has the air of a warehouse, less than a kitchen.  Sure there are
long, steel prep tables placed strategically around the grills, ovens and
microwaves.  Other kitchen tools are neatly hung from racks on the backs of
the double tiered prep tables.  And small appliances are grouped near their
prospective preparation areas.  A huge walk-in chiller is accessed from the
southern wall and some storage, shelving areas take up the northern end of
this large, open room.  The entrance to the prison hallway is accessed to the
east and the large. steel tambour door to the west leads to the loading dock.

   The cube of this room is bright with white walls, floor and ceiling, back
lit with an ambient white glow.  Silver lines trace over the room surfaces,
denoting places where panels, instruments, doors, etc. can be called up from
their internal sanctuaries for use in the programming processes.  A large,
white lounging chair is the only stationary feature in this room.  It is
bolted securely to the floor.  When in use, an inmate is strapped into the
seat and a wire has snaked out of the ceiling to attach itself into the
subject's datajack.

else to distract the guards from their primary focus, the inmates themselves
and the happenings around them.  There are doors that open to the Eastern
Courtyard and to the Processing Corridor from this room.  A yellow-painted
steel, staircase spirals upwards to the Second Floor Guard Room from this

Desc:$
   This is where the magic happens.  A bank of black mesh lounge chairs are
suspended from the ceiling by a myriad of wiring.  A retractable jack can be
found in the arm of each chair for easy access to the internal workings of the
lab.  A huge screen wraps around the west and northern wall.  Readouts of the
subject's health monitors, the program being input and the progress are
flickering over the enormous surface.  So much data that visually taking it
all in would be quite overwhelming.  The eastern wall is covered in floor to
ceiling one-way mirrors that allow the deckers to watch for people
approaching.

When the world-class deckers are alone in the room, the screen no longer is a
scrolling headache of data fields..it is a huge visualization of a
first-person-shooter game akin to the 20th Century video game, Doom.  Should
someone enter, the screen immediately changes back to the droll work related
stuff.

Name:	Warden's Office
Desc:$
   The north, east and west walls of the office are built of bulletproof,
one-way glass.  The southern wall is a bank of electronics and monitor screens
where the Warden can watch the goings on of his facility, control what he is
watching on the closed circuit system, play back, talk over a loud speaker,
etc.  A large desk sprawls in the middle of the space with a few chairs in
front for small meetings and one large, imposing black leather chair behind.

Name:	2nd Floor Guard Area
Desc:$
   Like the Guard Rooms on the first floor, this room is enclosed with
bulletproof glassteel with a few chairs and snacking stations strewn about.
The space is built for the guards to focus on the floor however, so it's
pretty bare otherwise.  A bright, yellow painted spiraling staircase curls up
from the East Guard Room below and on the West Guard Room side there is a hole
in the floor with a long pole running down for quick access to the ground
level.  To the south is the door to the Warden's Office and like spokes on a
wheel, brightly painted, yellow catwalks span out to the north, west and east
of this central room.
