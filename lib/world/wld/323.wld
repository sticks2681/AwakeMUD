Name:	Se-curo Ja Parking Lot
Desc:$
   From the edge of the parking lot you can see a huge neon sign saying
"Se-curo Ja!" in large Sperethiel characters, and a smaller sign bearing the
translation "The Chaos!" in English. You can already hear the blaring heavy
metal covers of the hottest songs out here. It's hell to try and find an empty
spot, and you can see the line of elves and humans waiting to get past the
bouncers, though some of the more scarred and rougher looking characters seem
to get in quicker, guess this is the new shadow bar you heard about.

a few steel grates lining its length to drain out the random fluids spilled
while working or cleaning.

Name:	Entering "Se-curo Ja!"
Desc:$
   Welcome to "Se-curo Ja!" or "The Chaos!", Seattle's hottest and only heavy
metal/strip club.  Just looking at the sign, it's obvious this place is
oriented towards elves, though there are a large number of humans enjoying
themselves inside, and even the occasional ork or troll.  The music is coming
from a live band on the stage to your east, drinks are being poured at the bar
to the north, and there are scantily clad and naked strippers and clubbers
dancing in cages and poles throughout the building.

Name:	At the Bar
Desc:$
   The bar is crowded and alive with motion as people leave their seats at the
table or the long, elaborate bar to dance, or sit down to watch the strippers
or other patrons enjoy themselves. To the side of the bar is a stairway
leading up to door with a small plaque that reads 'VIP Room' on it. The
movement of the serving staff, mostly barely dressed elven women, is enough to
boggle the mind as they scurry from table to table carrying drinks poured
rapidly by a tall, curvy elven woman in her mid-20s. The favorite drink seems
to be Taengele, an elvish liquor imported directly from Tir Tairngire. On the
far wall is a small ^Lsign^N with a short phrase etched into its surface.

Name:	The Joy Stick
Desc:$
   Through an entry way covered in neons that spell out "The Joy Stick",
flashing lights and the disctinctive sounds of virtual reality simsense games
lead to a wide open area, littered with VR arcade games. A light smoke fog drifts
through the VRCade, illuminated by seemingly random patterns of oscillating multi-
colored lasers and lights. The walls are lined with VRCade games, from stand-up
shooters to fully encapsulated Virtual Reality experiences. The middle of the room
is full of games, as well, all pointed outward like an island, with patrons crowding
some of the more popular games, watching on hitcher screens and cheering as the players
rack up high scores or destroy their competition. Framed posters and neon advertisements
for various games line the walls above the VRCade machines, the Mech Crew series and
Razorboy Brawl VI being the most numerous. Topless waitresses patrol the area, bringing
drinks and food from Se-curo Ja's bar, but for some reason, they go largely unnoticed.
The holy grail of VRCade machines sits against the center of the north wall, Mech Crew
Assault IV: Post-Modern Warfare. To the northeast, a simple doorless dorway leads to a
small set of stairs that leads to another section of games, a sign above it reading,
"Purchasing Counter".

comfortable, perfect for waiting on clients, or spending time with your new

   Unlike the rest of the club, the bathroom is well lit and spacious, as it
needs to be to accomidate both sexes at once. Mirrors and basins line one
wall, with the occasional couple sitting in front of a sink groping and
kissing. Urinals line another, and stalls the remaining two walls. Judging
from the sounds coming from a few of them, not all of them hold single
occupants.

   The floor is filled with dancing bodies, most scantily clad and smelling of
alcohol at this point. The air pulses with the music while black lights and
strobes illuminate the area. The groups of people dancing are frequently
broken by cages containing strippers or an adventurous clubber or three. It's
hard to tell which cage contains which, even looking at the cut and amount of
clothing in the bottom of them. A few barely clothed waitresses move through
the crowds, taking drinks to the private booths, one to the north, and another
far to the east. A dual set of wide, spiraling ^Lwrought iron^N stairs lead up
into the second level of the club here as well.

   This dancefloor much resembles the one next to the bar, drunken
half-dressed clubbers partying around the cages of completely undressed elves
and humans, who are probably just as drunk or getting paid by the hour. The
occasional scantily clad elven women bearing trays of drinks move through the
crowd headed towards the booth to the east. As usual, strobes and black lights
illuminate the area with help from the light show at the nearby stage and
moshpit, though light spills out of the unisex bathroom to the north. Dancer
cages hang above the dance floors, which seem to be occupied by the more
beautiful of those employed at the club.

wall next to the one-way mirror is a small switch connected to a surround
sound speaker system so that one can listen to the band below if they choose,
and on the wall opposite the couches is a large screen trid.  The faint sounds
of the party outside occasionally drift through the door, the sounds of wild
clubbers and a loud band on stage.  A scantily clad elven waitress brings a
tray of drinks in from time to time to keep the VIPs content.

   The office is completely spotless and orderly, the exact opposite of the
club below. With the door shuting out all noise from the club, you'd think you
were suddenly in a CEOs office at a megacorp headquarters. The desk is
massive, with a high backed leather chair behind it, matching the smaller
guest chairs in front of it. A comfortable couch is against one wall and
several filing cabinets on the other. The floor is covered with an expensive
rug and an huge painting covers most of the wall behind the desk. If given the
time or oppertunity to search the desk drawers, one can find a SOTA maglock
attached to the underside, though no indication of what it goes to.

   Small globed light fixtures shine down from a stainless steel paneled

by some of the corporations around the sprawl. Decor aside, it was quite
obvious this area was for security reasons, as there were cameras and all
sorts of other surveillance devices dotting the section of hallway, most of
them in plain sight, while the majority were concealed away. Hopefully you
have the authorization to be in the area, because the heavily armed sentry
turret here is observing traffic like a hawk, not to mention the guard 'dogs'
padding around the area looking for intruders.

   The hallway here is wide and high enough to allow for ease of movement of
large amounts of people. The floor was tiled in a black marble with a very
dark blue, subtle forked lightning-like design, extending out from various
points along its length. The ceiling had incorporates into it a thick wooden
layer, most likely a dark mahogany or laquer stained oak, esquisitely carved
and designed with various ancient elven and sperethiel runes and the like
carved into its face. Every five or so meters along the ceiling hang esquisite
lighting fixtures. Much like the ceiling, the trimming that hugged along the
floor on the wall was masterfully crafted, its artwork is very stylish, if not
pre-modern design. Thick wooden tresses with the same design protrude from the
shiney jet-black painted wall just above waist length. Every surface of this
hallway was completely clean and gleamed nicely along with the lighting
offered here. An immaculate, mirrored sliding glass door bars the path to the
east.

Desc:$
   Plain white walls raise upwards from a sea of blue carpet, the ocean of
fuzz is interrupted only by a large oak desk. The room reeks of a fresh carpet
smell and the only thing that distracts you from the god awful stench is the
never-ending cycle of, "Please hold!", coming from the secretary.

   The hallway here is wide and high enough to allow for ease of movement of
large amounts of people. The floor was tiled in a black marble with a very
dark blue, subtle forked lightning-like design, extending out from various
points along its length. The ceiling had incorporates into it a thick wooden
layer, most likely a dark mahogany or laquer stained oak, esquisitely carved
and designed with various ancient elven and sperethiel runes and the like
carved into its face. Every five or so meters along the ceiling hang esquisite
lighting fixtures. Much like the ceiling, the trimming that hugged along the
floor on the wall was masterfully crafted, its artwork is very stylish, if not
pre-modern design. Thick wooden tresses with the same design protrude from the
shiney jet-black painted wall just above waist length.

paintings look like they cost a fortune, so it may not be the best idea to
touch them, not to mention the fact they're obviously wired to alarms for
security reasons. A large set of dark mahogany double doors sits off the
southern end of the room, its trim done in an intricately carved decor, only
adding to this sections elegance and atmosphere.

   The floor here is almost exactly like the one below, other than than the
fact that a different band is performing up here and their music fills the air
instead of the one downstairs. The area is filled with dancing bodies, most
scantily clad and smelling of alcohol. The air pulses with the music while
black lights and strobes illuminate the area. The groups of people dancing are
frequently broken by cages containing strippers or an adventurous clubber or
three. It's hard to tell which cage contains which, even looking at the cut
and amount of clothing in the bottom of them. A few barely clothed waitresses
move through the crowds, taking drinks to the private booths, one to the
north, and another far to the east and west. A dual set of wide, spiraling
^Lwrought iron^N stairs lead back down to the ground level of the club here as
well.

   This is one of the few areas of the club that isn't going completely
insane, and instead hosts a calmer population, not consisting not so much of
dancers, but with spectators and observers who've stopped by for the show. A
few scantily clad elven women bearing trays of drinks move through the crowd,
tending to the orders of clubbers in the area and the private booth set up
towards the south. This is also once of the few areas beyond the bar that
offers seating and tables, as well as a few scattered ^Lblack leather^N sofas for
patrons to relax and enjoy the scenery from, for obvious reasons.

   More games line the walls here, and they're of an older, more noble stock.
A Pac-Man machine sits next to a Galaga cabinet, their old coin-slots modified
to accept credsticks. Across from these gems, A Double Dragon arcade cabinet
shares a space with a Space Invaders machine, and the coup de grace rests just
next to a long glass counter, the Tron arcade cabinet. Few people populate
this raised area of the VRCade. Most people just don't have the appreciation
for the classics. The glass counter displays various prizes and souveneirs,
small plastic figures and candy. Mech Crew figures line the back wall, a label
below them showing 'Not For Sale'. Above those, several T-shirts and hoodies
hang on the walls, displaying the name of the VRCade, some having funny or
quirky designs.

   Dim halogen lamps offer a small amount of light along this corridor, though
there are small wall mounted lamps incase of power failure. The floor and
walls are a dull shade of grey, unlike the other portions of the sub-level,
while the hallway itself abruptly comes to a dead end, offering no sign of
what was once here.

   This is obviously the security center for the complex, as it has a large

devices scattered through-out the building. Jackpoints have been integrated
for security riggers to literally become the building as needed for defense. A
portion of the room is dominated by an enormous generator, easily large enough
to handle the entire facility and clubs power needs. A bank of currently
maglocked breakers line one wall, each for a different level. With the help of
these systems the building itself is completely self-sufficient without the
need to be hooked into the city grid, which it currently is for standard
energy consumption levels.

Name:	Inside of the Hidden Grotto
Desc:$
   The only way into and out of this grotto within the cliffs is through a
hidden underwater passage near the bar and pool area. The lightning here is
fairly sparse and what little there is offered is dim, which helps add to the
atmosphere of the 'underground cavern' quality running rampant here. The
ledges surrounding the inner pool are wide enough and plentiful enough to
relax on after your swim, which makes good seating to take in the scenery of
interior of the structure here. Stalagmites and unhewn rock angle this way and
that in a very natural manner from the ceiling and walls, which help keep this
place relatively silent aside from the sound of water and the gentle rumbling
from the waterfall on the side of the cliffs you're beneath.

Desc:$
   This section of water flows in from the north and west and has no walkways
anywhere within its scenery. There is practically nothing out in this end of
the pool, that is, aside from a handful of large, unhewn boulders that sit
perched upon the top of the water, held up by unseen pillars beneath or by
some other invisible means concealed by the design and scenery. The
bouldersthemselves are rough and uncut, and could be climbed up onto and
perched upon, one or two of them were large enough to seat several people,
while the others were smaller and could hold a single person atop it. The
silence in the area is serene, and the water itself is still and calm, the
scenery itself stretching off into infinity much like everywhere else here.

   The walkway here turns into little more than circular walking stones, which
are collumns sinking down into the depths while sticking just slightly above
the surface of the water itself. The heavenly scent of ripened fruit and
flowers wafts through the area, and for good reason to, as you've stumbled
into a hydroponic grove in full blossom. Sprouting gently from the water are
^mplum^N trees with ripened plums perched upon their limbs, as well as ^yorange^N
trees with pristine ^Wwhite^N orange blossom flowers, and last but not the gentle
japanese ^Msakura^N trees, whose cherries seem ready to be picked and harvested
along with all the other flora here.

Desc:$
   From the top of the cliff to the west spills a sizable waterfall that
collects down into the depths of the open pool here. The rumbling noise of the
waterfall fills the area here and even more mist is being kicked up and
mingling with the omnipresent fog that covers the entire area like a blanket.
There doesn't seem to be any way back up the cliff, and aside from the water
stretching off into the distance to the north and east, there seems to be
clearer pathway of water towards the south. A few ^Lwrought iron^N lanterns with
hoods to protect themselves from the water are anchored into the sides of the
cliff, adding a little to its scenery as well as offering the area a bit of
much needed light.

   Despite being fully furnished and decorated, this room has the distinct
feel of being treated mostly as a very large closet. Random shoes and a few
spare items of clothing are strewn about the plush carpet and more clothing is
spread out on the large pillow-covered bed, likewise with the comfortable
looking couch and loveseat set. Besides the well lit, drawing desk tucked into
a corner, the only part of the room that seems to get regular use is the large
bathroom. Done completely with ivory and pale gold fixtures and tile with
vibrant crimson towels and bath mats, the sink area is surrounded by cosmetics
of every sort and shade while bath salts, bubble bath, and body wash ring the
massive bath tub. The angular designs in the frosted glass making up the walls
of the large shower enclosure allow for somewhat distorted glimpses within.

   It's clear the owner of this room loves the color red. The carpets are a deep
crimson, plush and soft to bare feet. The apartment itself runs the length of the
VRCade below, and it's south wall is a one-way mirror window, allowing those in the
apartment to look down on the VRCade without fear of those below seeing what's going
on upstairs. A gorgeous king-sized bed rests in the corner of the west and north wall,
deep crimson sheets, comforter and pillows haphazardly placed on it, as if the owner
never bothers to make the bed. A large entertainment center sits against the south one
way mirror wall, complete with a Trideo display and minidisc player, as well as other
various entertainment electronics, wires and chords crisscrossing beneath and behind.
Various posters of electonic bands from the '80 and '90s dot the walls, extremely old
and crumbling, or newer replicas. A stark bathroom door sits in the middle of the
northern wall, or rather, the frame, as the door has been removed and is nowhere to be
found. The bathroom is a vision of sterile perfection compared to the bedroom, sink and
counters wiped clean and shining, mirror without a streak to be found. A stand-up shower
sits in the corner, the transparent glass door offering an excellent view of the bed in
the other room. Or is it the other way around?

Name:	Stepping out onto the roof
Desc:$
   Stepping out onto this roof is akin to stepping into another realm all
together. The sky is hidden completely by a calm, weightless fog-like mist,
which extends out in all directions and envelopes everything in the area,
which in turn gives a 'just before dawn' quality to it. The scenery was
breath-taking to say the least, immaculately clean and crisp. Currently one
would be standing upon the central 'island', which was a flawless,
smooth-edged block of some unknown kind of stone, measuring several meters
wide with the ascending staircase tucked down into its center. The sound of
gently moving water is always present, as it covers every single last bit of
the floor here, aside from where walkways crafted of the same stone you're
standing on dot the landscape. The water itself reflects with an almost ^Lpure
black^N colour, taking up the shade of the stone walkways. Theres obviously an
illusionary technique of some type incorporated into the entire design, making
this place seem to stretch out each horizon.

Desc:$
   The walkway widens here towards to the south into a rectangular section of
stone that acts as a patio at the waters edge, which comes right up to the lip
of the stone and melds almost seamlessly, making it hard to distinguish which
is solid or liquid, the entire area seems to be like that, it would be wise to
watch ones step here. Masterwork wrought ^Lblack iron^N benches sits on each side
of the area, as well as a few ^Lblack^N carved stone seats and benches sprouting
up here and there from the foundation itself. One could have a seat and relax,
stare out into the never-ending distance shrouded by the blanket of fog, or
even go for a dip in the water if one cared to, as it was relatively deep
everywhere. A large ^Lblack iron^N and stone fire pit sits in the middle of all of
the seatings arrangements, just incase a bit of grilling needs to be done.

into the water, which is only really noticable when its active. The scenery is
dotted with stoic ^Lblack marble^N statues of an enlightened roman based sculpture
and design, as well as an occasional shaded grey granite potters with various
kinds of flora. The entire atmosphere is extremely relaxing here, and the
scenery itself disappears in each direction by that ever present fog, even the
waters edge to the west seems to stretch out forever, shrouded from viewers
attempts to peer at what lays beyond.

Name:	The top of the Grotto
Desc:$
   The walkway gives way to a path as it leads up to the cliff-like structures
sprouting up from the depths of the water and pushing up into the air here
quite a few meters high. Its unhewn surface and design give it an all natural
appeal that looks very out of place in comparison to the rest of the scenery
around here. The path itself winds up along its outer layers up until the very
top, upon which sits a large pool of water that forms out of the ground itself
and flows eastward. A waterfall effect can be both heard and seen as the water
spills off from the cliffs and down into a deep reserve pool beneath, which
also doubles as a great place to leap from down into the water. A few
seemingly natural formations in the rock act as make-shift seats and tables,
just in case you want to relax and take in the rest of the areas down below,
since this was easily the best spot for a birds-eye view for the scenery.

Name:	A Grand Private Foyer
Desc:$
   The foyer here serves as an entryway from the 2nd floor landing to the
large, lavish apartment that lies beyond. The foyer itself is a small room
compared to the rest of the apartment, serving a more practical purpose than a
decorative one. Two large potted plants stand on marble columns on both sides
the large mahogany door, and pure gold hangers line one side, with room to
place ones shoes underneath.

Name:	A Luxurious Modern Living Room
Desc:$
   This large living room acts as a central point for the entire apartment.
The room itself is modern in decor, the lights the walls and everything in the
room bear a modern but classy appeal. A low wooden table sits in the center of
the room with a couch and a loveseat nearby, but not as to obstruct movement
in and out of the room. A large SOTA trid sits in one corner of the room wired
to a elaborate surround sound system to allow for maximum viewing pleasure. A
fireplace sits in the other corner, complementing the rich hardwood floors
coverd by lavish rugs. The room is well lit and the walls are decorated by
expensive works of art, creating a warm, luxurious atmosphere.

Flooring in this room differs from the others as it is a dark marble and
shines with an immaculate cleanliness. The stainless steel appliances that
make up most of the decoration are SOTA, and would make even a gourmet cook
drool. Aside from the appliances, various cooking utensils are set up on the
marble countertops and in the drawers and a marble topped island provides for
comfortable and efficiant food preperation.

far as the eye can see there is nothing but sand, ragged outcrops of rock, and
sparse plantlife, most of which are dead grass and desert shrubs, quite a few
cactuses dot the sand-filled landscape. For some odd reason the desert expanse
heads all the way out towards the horizen without an end in sight, which is
mostly obscured due to the fact it perpetually seems to be Dusk here, an
obvious home to the denizens of the night.

   Settled here amidst the small sandy dunes, you almost overlook what seems
to be a small pond, an Oasis to be exact, surrounded by desert shrubs and a
few large cactuses, a small Coyote sits on the waters edged, casually going
about its business getting in its fill of fluids, obviously too busy to even
pay any attention to newcomers. A single beach chair is sitting right next to
where the Coyote laps up its water, a matching umbrella stuck into the sand,
yet still folded up neatly. A few meters beyond the watering hole is a sudden
drop, a ragged outcropping of sandstone shielding the view of whats seems to
be a rather long drop off of a cliff, a deffinate sign you won't be going any
further.

seen in your life, it seems to extend up and beyond for a couple of hundred
feet, set at such an incline that it would be nearly if not fully impossible
to scale without sliding right back down where you started, perhaps getting
buried by the flow of sand in the process. A large weathered boulder sits at
the foot of the dune, surrounded by dead grass and other desert flora, a few
pale white desert lotus flowers have sprung forth from beneath the sides of
the rock, helping add to the impression that it might be a nice place to take
a seat and rest.

   Here the expanse switches sparaticly between small dunes and stretches of
wave-like patterns of sandy flatland, the occasional small desert creature
darting between what little overgrowth was allowed by the harsh enviroment.
This area seems to be running rampant with Tumbleweeds, which bounce and roll
across the dunes and flatland, sometimes in packs, apparently racing along
with the help of the wind.. which oddly enough, didn't seem strong enough to
even steal away even a strand of hair, you soon enough find yourself busy
dodging tumbleweeds as they roll past, which seemed to purposely nip by your
heels as they pass.

   To your direct east is a disturbance in the landscape, and are unable to
make out exactly what it is until you're almost directly upon it, fortunately
enough you come to a stop before you find out what it was the hard way,
literally. A barren wall of heavy stone seems to spring forth from nowhere
right infront of you, a sand haze flickering over it as it shifts and gleams
lightly, you even catch sight of a stone flooring as well as a similiar
looking ceiling structure. Apparently you're inside of a building.. but...
what of the desert that surrounds you? After taking quite a few minutes of
hard thought, you come to the realization that almost all of it is an
illusion, what kind of creature would do such a thing? Perhaps you shouldn't
stick around long enough to find out, Carrion tends to show up in deserts, now
doesn't it?

pool of water that stretches out further than you can measure towards the
horizon, which is shrouded by the omnipresent ^Wfog^N that hangs over the entire
area. The surface of the water here is completely calm and still, and aside
from the sound of gently rumbling water off in the distance it was almost
completely silent here, no birds, no insects, a solemn void of sound. The pool
continues along north and south with a complete absence of the usual walkways
scattered around, so prepare for a swim if you plan on getting anywhere. An
almost over-bearing sense of silent, calm harmony permeates the area here, and
can be very relaxing after a long day or night.

Desc:$
   The smooth, flawless ^Lblack^N stone walkway wraps along the side of the
cliff-like scenery to the east, eventually coming to a halt into a circular
portion constructed from the same stone set at the end of the path. This
submerged pool is sectioned off from the main body of water that is all around
it, their contents overlapping one another due to its lip being just beneath
water level. The circular pool itself is quite large, very deep in the middle,
while towards the northern end of it there seems to be a bar integrated
directly into the scenery. Small and smooth, carved ^Lblack^N stone tables sit
just above the water, while matching carved stone seats are hidden beneath
infront of them in the water itself. A few more of the stoic, roman-esque
statues line the edges of the walkways and pool, which help add to the over
all appeal and design of the section.

tending to the orders of clubbers in the area and the private booth set up
towards the south. This is also once of the few areas beyond the bar that
offers seating and tables, as well as a few scattered ^Lblack leather^N sofas for
patrons to relax and enjoy the scenery from, for obvious reasons.

Name:	Before the second floor stage
Desc:$
   This part of the club is going completely wild as a large crowd of clubbers
mosh and dance around the front of the stage in an absolute frenzy. The entire
southern wall and stage itself is dominated by electronics and synthlink
connection cables that run to the ^Lblack metal^N and ballistic ^Cglass^N canister
sitting on the middle of the stage, which is literally interfacing itself with
the clubs sound and lighting systems. Lasers from the stage stream through the
misty air overhead as black lights and strobes bursting in time with the music
light the area illuminate scene, and while the music itself is nearly
deafening, its damn good.

Desc:$
   This dancefloor resembles the other parts of the club, tons of drunken
half-dressed clubbers partying around cages of completely undressed elves and
humans, who are probably just as drunk or getting paid by the hour. The
occasional scantily clad elven woman bearing trays of drinks move through the
crowd, heading towards the private booth set up to the east end of the club.
As usual, strobes and black lights illuminate the area with help from the
light show at the nearby stage and moshpit.

desk is littered with scrolls, open books and complicated arcane equations
scribbled on parchment.

the floor and there are a few lit candles scattered around for light. Opposite
the bed a large poster of some semi-naked elven rockers takes a place of pride
on the wall.

   This small room is dimly lit and covered by cobwebs in which you can see
many black spiders. The bulk of the space is taken up by a huge lodge in the
center. There is an altar set up holding a row of metahuman skulls, the
remains of burnt offerings in front of them smoking gently, leaving a musky
smell in the air. Across the ceiling a large web has been spun, reminding you
of a galaxy as it shimmers in the candlelight. The room is eerily quiet, you
feel cut off from the outside world. In the back you see an old cabinet and a
hammock strung up in one corner, the only furnishings in the room.
