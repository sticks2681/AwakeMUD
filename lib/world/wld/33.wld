Name:	Inside the White Buffalo Pen
Desc:$
   This large, penned-in area is a permanent home for two large White Buffalo.
These two specimens are actually property of the Denver Zoo, but are part of
an inter-zoo animal trading program and were one of the first awakened species
to be put onto display at the Seattle Municipal Zoo. Fresh food is brought in
to them daily, but judging by their disgruntled dispostions, they would
obviously much rather be fending for themselves in the open plains.

Name:	Inside the Bandit Cage
Desc:$
   The interior of the Bandit cage is littered with trees here and there,
though unlike most of the other open air exhibits, this area had to be caged
in to keep the little critters from escaping. Several of the creatures can be
seen hiding up in the trees, either lounging around or causing mischief as
they're apt to do. One will immediately notice that several spots in the cage
have been shored up keep them from escaping as well, as they have shown an
incredible knack for doing exactly that.

Desc:$
   This is the home of the Bombardiers, which resemble large flying squirrels,
who apparently enjoy nothing more than dropping things on unsuspecting
victims, so anyone who ventures inside should keep an eye out on the little
devils above. There are many trees nearby in which they make their nests,
almost all of which reach all the way up to the fenced in roofing that keeps
them from escaping.

they're saber-fragging-toothed cats, shouldn't it already be common knowledge
that it's a bad idea to come into this cage in the first place..?

for viewing during feeding time, which consists of the zoo keepers releasing
small rodents and birds who have had their wings clipped, making for easy
prey. Small little hovels have been dug into the dirt all around the
enclosure, making for perfect spots to hide in and ambush their lunch.

Name:	Along a cobblestone pathway
Desc:$
   The air is full of the sounds of childrens laughter mixed with the noise of
cheerful music as you walk along this section of the pathway. Unfortunately,
the smell of animals also accompanies the scenery, and it isn't always very
pleasant, but at least the view is. To the west is the southern entrance of
the zoo, while down along the frequently swept cobblestone pathway to the east
is a T-shaped junction leading to a portion of the animal enclosures.

   You stand outside the Mini-Petting Zoo, where a small fence keeps the more
tame of animals from roaming around, however, one can effortlessly reach over
the fence in order to pet and feed the animals that stand near its perimeter.
A double gate in the center of the fence allows zookeepers access to feed and
care for the animals inside, as well as allow visitors to walk in and pet the
animals if they desire.

   This area has been decorated as an old-fashioned farm pen, containing
numerous troughs lining the perimeter of the fence, so the animals
conveniently have to get near the spectators to eat and drink. Many bales of
hay are arranged around an old farm wagon, and there is one central water
trough in the center of the area just in case the others are occupied. This is
a new attraction to the zoo, and several types of animals are being displayed
here at this time, mostly for the children to pet and feed.

PIASMA
Scientific Name: Ursus piasma
The piasma is a well-adapted predator derived from the north american black
bear(Ursus americanus). It has a stout body, which favors strength over 
speed. The piasma's ears are short and its large head is equipped with the
thick, short tusks of a boar. It has typical bear feet with large, rending
claws. A male adult piasma reaches a height of 1.5 meters and can weigh
over 600 kilograms.

 The icedrake is a lizard that reaches a length of up to 1.5 meters and
closely resembles a western dragon, as it has no wings. It has small red eyes,
and is a carnivore. It is a very aggressive predator, and its diet consists
mainly of mountain sheep and goats, along with any other animals it can chase
down or ambush. This includes unlucky (meta)humans, so teasing the specimen is

covered with scales, which range in colour from a reddish brown to a light tan

Name:	Inside the Chimpanzee Cage
Desc:$
   There are several tall synth-oak trees inside the cage being used by the
primates for not only shelter, but as a playground of sorts. The cage's
occupants regard tresspassers curiously when approached, but are more than
likely more afraid of anyone brave enough to enter and aren't likely to attack
unless provoked, fortunately. They are, however, very likely to pelt anyone
stupid enough to enter their enclosure with their favourite projectile, none
other than their own feces.

   A low, rumbling growl is apt to send a shiver down the spine of passerby's
as they walk past this cage. Peering in, one can see an incredibly large brown
grizzly bear inside of the pen. There is a spacious cave which serves as a
shelter for the animal, which is tucked away in the corner of the cage.

   It would be around this time that the little voice in the back of your head
should be telling you that it might not have been such a great decision to
enter this cage. However, since you decided against the application of a
little common sense, you'll have to deal with the consequences that accompany
stumbling blindly into the habitat of a grizzly bear, which usually leads to
having your face eaten and turn into lovely bear patties.

the rows of cages lining the side of the walkway. Visitors and their children
mill through the junction, blabbering and making a ruckus all the while, which
probably ticks off the animals quite a bit. But, who cares what's good for the
animals? This is a zoo afterall, if they really cared, they probably wouldn't
have them stuffed into cages to begin with.

what you remember from that U.S. History chip you scanned a while back. The
pathway continues from west to east, leading to the various creature exhibits.

   You stand before the entrance to the Seattle Municipal Zoo, which is
surrounded by a ten foot high brick wall, adding a quaint, if not outright
antique touch to this place in an attempt to class it up a little. Nowadays,
new composite materials are the norm in construction, but the majority of this
place was built over a century ago. Although not as structurally sound as the
pre-fabbed materials, the masonwork adds a nice touch and is easier on the
eyes, as long as old fashioned appearances appeals to your tastes. Swarms of
visitors, mostly with their children in tow, mill past the ticket booths,
eager to get a glimpse of the animals on display here.

Desc:$
   You stand before the Saber-toothed Cat exhibit, inside of which one can see
two of the magnificent creatures lounging about, minding their business and
doing what giant man eating cats do best: Look intimidating. There is a small
^yplaque^N on a wooden post in front of the cage, and a door marked 'Women's
Restroom' leads off to the east.

This plaque reads: Saber-Toothed Cat
 Scientific Designation: Felis Novalis
 The saber-toothed cat is an awakened species derived from the cougar or
mountain lion (Felis concolor). It reaches a length of about 1.8 meters at
full maturity, and is distinguished by its two large, curved fangs that
protrude down from its upper jaw. The cat is fast and powerful, and its thick
coat is a tawny brown and features very little in the way of markings.

Desc:$
   You are now standing outside of the Shadowhound pen. Since direct sunlight
is harmful to creatures the zoo architects have built a large dome over the
pen which is lined with low-light lamps, allowing visitors to view the animals
without causing harm to them. There is a small ^yplaque^N on a wooden post in
front of the pen, offering information on the creature contained inside.

This plaque reads: Shadowhound
 Scientific Designation: Canis Umbrae
 The shadowhound resembles a huge dog and often reaches a height of 1.2-1.3
meters at the shoulder. Its coat is a charcoal gray colour marked with dark
black patches, which have the ability to move and shift. This provides the
creature with excellent camouflage at night, as it is a nocturnal predator
that feeds on rabbits, rats, deer and other small mammals.

   You stand in the middle of a busy intersection, which has quite a bit of
foot traffic as visitors continue on their way to the western portion of the
zoo which contains species of Non-Awakened animals, while off in the other
directions are the awakened animal exhibits. The pathway continues from north
to south, with a nice rest area to the west.

   The interior of the pen here resembles a small forest with dense
vegetation, with a small cave nearby for the creature inside to seek shelter
in. The cave features a clear safety glass wall, allowing visitors to view the
Black Annis during the daytime (since it's nocturnal) and giving it as little
privacy as possible. There is a small ^yplaque^N attached to a wooden post outside
the cage.

The plaque reads: Black Annis
 Scientific Designation: Papio Annisae
 The Black Annis is a humanoid creature standing 1.7 meters tall with a
hunched posture, and most taxonomists believe it to be an awakened form of
Mandrill (Papio Sphinx). The creatures are highly territorial and aggressive
carnivores, using their strength and speed to overpower prey. They are
nocturnal hunters with exceptional night vision, making them very dangerous to
deal with if anyone stumbles into their territory.

   Another exhibit that features quite a number of trees in its display is
here, home to the Bomardier, many of whom are roosting in the upper branches,
as high as they possibly can before hitting the fenced in roof topping off the
pen. The little critters fly and drift about between the trees, helping
themselves to what little airspace they have offered to them. There is a small
weathered ^yplaque^N posted infront of the cage, like many of the other exhibits.

The plaque reads: Bombardier
 Scientific Designation: Glaucomys Teli
 The Bombardier is an awakened version of the flying squirrel (Glaucomys
Volans), and it resembles a slightly larger version of its progenitor. They
are indigenous to the wooded areas along the North American East Coast, and
are very similar to the typical flying squirrel, subsisting mostly on nuts and
berries, and hibernating in the winter on a store of hoarded food.

small polished ^yplaque^N that is fastened to a wooden post in front of the cage.

 Scientific Designation: Bison Bison Blanc
 The White Buffalo, an awakened form of the plains bison, is much larger than
their mundane cousins. As their namesake implies, they have brilliant white
hair and short dark horns, standing on average at a height of 3.0 meters at
the shoulder and nearly 5.2-5.3 meters in length. More territorial and
aggressive than their common relatives, Native American legends are abound
that the White Buffalo existed long before the awakening, but disappeared into
the pages of history.

   Set along side the cobblestone pathway is a medium sized cage housing what
appears to be several large raccoons sitting in the trees inside. The zoo
seems to have gone through quite a bit of trouble to reinforced and double
(sometimes even tripling) the safety measures to keep these mischievous little
creatures inside of their cages, as they are notorious for having escaped more
times than the employees care to admit. A small ^yplaque^N is fastened to a wooden
post in front of the cage.

 The Bandit is an Awakened version of the raccoon (Procyon lotor), and is
larger than its mundane cousins, growing up to 1.0 meter in length, it also
has opposable thumbs. The Bandit is an omnivore, subsisting on roots, berries,
small mammals and even water fowl. It is notorious for rummaging through
garbage cans in various parks and urban areas. It is an accomplished thief of
food and shiny objects, and shows a remarkable cunning for a supposedly
non-sentient creature. There are rumors of language and tool use among Bandit
families, as well as an innate ability to open simple locks and latches.
