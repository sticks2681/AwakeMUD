Name:	A Shady Corner
Desc:$
   You stand at the corner of the back alley, just before a squat brick
building that looks as if it has not been acknowledged in decades. Cracked
pavement cruches under your feet, and a neon sign attempts to blink out a
phrase, but seems to be unable to muster the strength.  A filthy set of stairs
leads to a peeling oak door just north of you.

   As you step inside the brick menace, you find yourself at the head of a
narrow hallway, stretching back out of view into the gloom.  Where you stand,
the corridor opens up into something of a foyer, with odd images on the walls
and layers of dust at your feet.  The Hallway extends off to the west of you,
and the door out is behind you to the south.

a desk are in the center, seemingly used as a good spot for a campfire, as

clinic's guards.  Banks of monitors and access panels line the walls, each

including a little information about yourself.  Another room of similar

not see large sums of money in a year's time, they have been able to afford at
least minimum security precautions for their data.  Looking to the east you
see the complex core of the central processing unit.  All around you seem to
be small cubical and crystalline shapes, seemingly virtual representations of
the information being stored here.  While nothing of  use to you is in this
paticular sector, perhaps further towards the memory storage area you may find
something.

   You stand in the center of a wide open grid, surrounded by hovering shapes
much like the ones you saw as you first entered at the gateway.  They are
neatly arranged by their repsective addresses, and float serenely in place
until called upon by either the CPU or a courier to be used or transferred.
The grid extends to the south, while the brilliant light of the CPU is
southwest of you.

Desc:$
   All pharmaceutical facilities from retail to research are compliant under
the overseeing eye of PharmaCom, the leading corporation in drug development
and sales.  The clinic pharmacy is no exception - all orders, stock counts and
transactions must be made known to PharmaCom, and the Matrix is the means by
which the data is transferred.  The node you find yourself in is of a high
quality, as is anything that PharmaCom involves itself with. The CPU toils
away to the south, compliling and outputting data to the corporation mainframe
elsewhere.

   The ramp into the underground garages dips sharply and curves around under
the apartment complex. It is barely wide enough for one vehicle and is very
small, disallowing entrance to anything large than a station wagon. Even an
SUV would have problems fitting in here. More than half of the overhead lights
are out, meaning travelling through here safely requires you to switch on your
headlights.
