#18100
Name:	Entrance to Forest Park
Desc:$
   This park seems clean, having very small amounts of litter and other
garbage around. You see a pavement path through the grass, leading further
into the park. It extends ahead into a forested area, shading it from almost
any sunlight, and setting a fairly dark atmosphere even in daylight. A bench
sits on the left side of the path, just before it enters into the forest.

#18101
Name:	Further into Forest Park
Desc:$
   Here the pavement path branches off into several different directions. The
park seems to get slightly darker as you head deeper into it, and gives you
the impression this is not the type of place to go for a jog in. Sounds of
small critters running through bushes and the occasional chirp of a bird add
to the ambient noise of the area. Small leaves and twigs litter the pavement,
and the you notice a few cracks and bumps from over grown tree roots.

Name:	In front of a small pond
Desc:$
   The path stops here in front of a small, somewhat murkey pond. Benches sit
on either side of it, though it seems one usually has a humanoid figure
covered up in newspapers occupying it. The area above the pond is free of any
tree branches, allowing the sun or moonlight to glisten on it's surface during
a clear day. Leaves flutter from the the sorrounding trees into the pond when
the wind picks up, and faintly disturb the otherwise tranquil feeling of the
area.
