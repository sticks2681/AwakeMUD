Name:	Entrance to Rocky Horror Picture Show
Desc:$
   This old theater looks rather dark and dingy, there are old, torn movie
posters hanging in a plastic case. The porch is tiled in the most hideous
green, most of which are broken.  "Welcome to RHPS, You're just in time for
the show" says the ticket vendor.
