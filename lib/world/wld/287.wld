Name:	Entrance
Desc:$
   Outside of Kristin's Restaurant everything is high class. The finely
trimmed grass, the carefully pruned hedges and the expensive automobiles in
the parking lot.There is quadruple glass doors leading into this compound for
the hungry upperclass, with gold plated handles and gold trim. There is a sign
that perpetually reads Open on the inside, for the rich (and hungry) should
never be turned away from a fine cuisine. The doors open to the North, leading
into the nice eatery.

Name:	Waiting Room
Desc:$
   From the glass doors to the south and the velvet ropes blocking the way to
the north, this is the finest waiting room possible.  Plush Benches provide
comfort and luxiourious coat racks give a place to hang the leather and furs.
Noises along with wonderous smells drift in from the dining areas, providing a
great aroma and vibe, only making everything more delicious.

Desc:$
   This brightly lit room has several people heading into and out of the
dining area. The waiting room is south while in an eastern direction, through
a solid looking door and past a sign that clearly claims no minors are allowed
beyond that point come sounds of drunken stupor and silliness. North is where
the tables are for the people who can afford to eat here. Tasty smells glance
the nose, entralling it with the pleasantries of fine dining.

   Several tables fill the floor space with chairs accompanying them. Upper
class families eat meals, talking, enjoying their lives without suffering.
Smells drift about fromm all the corners of this room, which continues in
almost all the directions, bringing you to more dining tables and happy
people, except south which takes you back towards the exit.

Desc:$
   Tipsy rich men (and women) of all shapes and sizes stumble around drinking
to oblivion. Loud voices and the stench of alcohol, all types of it, invades
the clean air when the door to the west is opened.  Thick smoke, from tobacco
amoung other things creates a rich foggy haze, killing your lungs in the
process. Everyone in here seems not to notice, especially the bartenders and
normal drunkards who live in here.

   Several bartenders work behind the counters making tips and mixing the hard
liquor in a winning attempt to make the rich loose with their wallets and
pocket books. Weary men and women pass from the stress of work into submission
to alcohol all around, boredom solved my a mix of toxins. Some people are
passed out and others sit and smoke what ever is rolled in the paper held in
their mouth. To the north is the Bar exit out into the restuarant and to the
south is more of the bar.

   The end room in the bar, it is by far the biggest, loudest, and nicest.
More of a comfort lounge than a bar, drinks are still served here, though in
an extremely relaxed atmosphere. There are several couches with several drunks
sleeping on them while a group of people pass around a fat spliff.

   Exquisite tables decorated in eloquent tables clothes are carefully
arranged on the floor, in a certain pattern to create a tranquility that eases
the mind, bringing the mind to a seemingly unattainable level where eating is
made possible no matter what state of mind you're in. Family chatter glides
through the air softly, hushed by the serene surroundings, in order to keep
the peace.

   The decorative lights shine down on the fancy tables and classy people
eating. A few over whelmed waiters rush from rich person to rich person hoping
for a sizable tip, though odds against it. Every now and then a frantic waiter
(or waitress) might slip up and hide out back for a bit. Though in this area
smoking in discouraged, several people are, and pretty much doing so oblivious
to others health. Though this is the dining area, alcohol is served, but the
harder, less eloquent stuff is only available in the bar.

   This section is darker and more personal, for more of meeting type dinners.
An electronics descrambler is hidden under each table and the hiss of a white
noise generator is heard in the background. The tables arent as heavily
decorated, there is nothing shiny and polished reflecting from the dim light.
Several sketchy characters are about with rich and powerful looking mean with
nothing to fear, or maybe not. Why else would they be meeting with a runner?
