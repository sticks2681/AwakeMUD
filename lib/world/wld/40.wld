Name:	Entrance to Seattle State Park
Desc:$
   Through twin columns of steel flanked on either side, is Seattle State
Park.  The breathtaking views spiral off into distance shades of various
greens and greys, splashed with the added colours that are far too many to
name.  A wide gravel path slithers into the awaiting fields, inviting all to
indulge in the scenery.

Desc:$
   Entering the park, the calming atmosphere is undeniable. Well kept and
unmistakably clean, it's clear a lot of effort has gone into maintaining the
park as one of the very rare and few havens from filth.  The pale gravel path
splits and forks in numerous directions, leading further in between green
fields.

   2 Playing fields surround the current location, dotted between pathways and

   It's clear to even the untrained eye that the forest is man made, the
spacing of  the trees evenly done.  Despite the effort to recreate nature, the
forestry is eerily beautiful of its own accord. A carpet of dead pine needles
and leaves blanket any sounds, while the treetops mingling over head contain
any other sounds.  Light streams through any available gaps, highlighting the
particles in the air as if it were fairy dust.

   Variations in tree species alternate between evergreens and willows, still
spaced apart by man. A large, gnarled oak tree twists it way through the

wildlife.  Curling across the ground is the likes of a man-made stream, the
melodic sounds whispering throughout the area.

   Through a set of untarnished steel gates is a modest little house with a
well kept garden sprawling about it.  Locked and securely so, the movement of
small wildlife can be caught moving through the shrubbery.

   Surrounding this point are the grassy fields, lined with an unknown amount
of benches for people to rest on, or to simply enjoy the landscape.  Bins for
litter have been strategically placed close to each seat, encouraging citizens
to dispose of their rubbish properly. The path continues one toward the

   Directly opposite this point is the serene waters of the lake, the gentle

pine forest to the north, and the large body of water are the grassy fields,

   Standing on the main, wide path that runs through the center of the park,
it's clear that a lot of dedication has gone into the care of Seattle State
Park.  Benches have been places near bins for visitors to take a seat and
enjoy the view, while in the background is the distant trickle of water from
the fountain.  Just behind this central feature, is the looming shadow of a
large house to north.

peppering any dry weather with moisture.

   Standing proud at the center of the park is a lavish fountain, constantly
churning water to create a melodic and natural music.  The entirety of the
park can be seen in some fashion from this point, from the fields to the lake,
and the forestry to boot.  Surrounding the main feature are four benches,
placed at exact locations around the base of the fountain, while on the edge
of the path are two signs.  The first directs south, reading '^GPark Entrance^n',
while the second directing east reads '^YBathrooms^n'.

   The path is rather wide, being one of the main ones that goes through the
park, and goes through the so-called forest.  This part seems devoid of the
natural life that seems to inhabit the northern end.

   The density of the forest ends quite abruptly, but the shadows cast from
the trees stretching upward still cast a light shade across the floor. Grassy
fields stretch on to the south, while to the east a glimmer of the park center
shimmers in the distance. The bow of branches dance on the wind, orchestrating
a soft, soothing calm.

across the skyline, blotting out a good potion of the sky above. Tangles of
roots have lifted through the soil, reaching across to one another to create a
semi circular pattern across the ground.

Name:	The Eastern End of the Forest
Desc:$
   Much the same as the rest of the forest line, the trees are substantially
thinner, dotted with saplings sprouting in place of those that have either
fallen or been torn down for some reason. A real attention to preservation is
evident, the meticulous preening to ensure that the trees don't spill over
into the fields marked by the severe straight line to seperate.

disinfectant has embedded itself in the tiles.

Desc:$
   Placid tones of lapping water carry across the air, overlaying the hustle
of busier life outside the park. The slight uneven slope leading through the
field dips and swells to create shadow in the green grass. A few picnic
benches have been placed in groups of four along the field.

Evidently this section of field is designed for those who like to play
baseball.  At each point are white, leather bound mats, and even though the
field isn't big enough for a league team, it's adequately sized for a family
game.

   This is the southernmost part of the grassy fields.  To the north and west
you see a lot of people cramped onto the small area of the fields, but where
you stand now there are very few people.  Maybe it's because of the pigeons
that normally fly directly above....

Name:	A Toilet Stall
Desc:$
   In contrast to the rest of the bathroom, this single cubicle appears to be
a solace from the filth and grime creeping over everything. The toilet is for
the most part white, and there seems to be no graffiti marks or cigarette
burns on anything in the immediate vicinity.

Desc:$
   Smooth, wide concrete steps descend into quite a dark stairwell beneath.
Handrails of polished steel are bolted into the grey walls that encase the
area, muffling any sound that could potentially carry into the rooms beyond.

   Cresting before the first floor landing, the plush red carpet underfoot
comes to a rather abrupt stop. Curving around toward the south, the landing

   Set on small, marble plated tables are single stone sculptures, mostly
finished to a glossy shine, dotted along the hallway between doors and
beautiful paintings. It's not unlike an art gallery, but showing off wealth
instead of artistic skill.

Name:	A Decorated Hallway
Desc:$
   Curving from west to east, this hallway is relatively dark considering the
lack of windows. A warm glow comes from a raging fire somewhere along the
hallway, accompanied by a subtle heat to warm the toes. A large, portrait
painting has been hung on the wall of an old oriental man sitting proudly in
traditional Japanese clothing.

   Heated by an eight foot tall fireplace, the crackling flames are kept
alight by an attendant that comes along quite frequently, judging by the
health of the fire. Twin sets of rosewood doors lead north and south, the wax
finish done expertly to show the grain of the doors.

   Trivial background noise is emitted from a wall mounted Tri-D set, vainly
masking the camera set slightly above it to spy on intruders. A small, antique
looking table is set toward the left side of the room with two comfortable
chairs. A chess game, barely begun, has been left to its devices, the
occupants probably being too dim witted to complete it.

decorated in finery that reflects the owners wants for comfort. Oriental in
influence, the decor is muted and simple, but no less beautiful than a
lovingly painted woman. A fireplace crackles in the northern wall, fronted by
an onyx marble surround.
