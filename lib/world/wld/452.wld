Name:	I-5 at Seattle Metroplex Border
Desc:$
   As the I-5 crosses off of Spencer Island it is brought to a halt by the
border post between Seattle and the Salish-Shidhe region. All vehicles are
stopped and checked before being let through. The guards here are far more
polite and easy-going than most other border posts, but still armed to the
teeth and ready to deal with any troublemakers.

down house can be seen along the tops of the embankments on either side,

   The view from the east side of the I-5 at this point is dominated by the
Jackson Park Golf Course. Green lawn stretches out, dotted with trees and well
manicured playing areas. The other side of the interstate is in stark
contrast, a solid grey sound wall, helping residents on that side sleep easier
at night.

Desc:$
   Northgate mall lies to the east of the I-5 here. The colossal brown
buildings that house a variety of shops have seen better days and are in dire
need of a make over. Apartment buildings rise over the I-5 to the west, most
likely low rent, as the noise from the interstate is not blocked by the near
ubiquitous sound walls that cover most of the I-5 in this area of Seattle.

   The I-5 seems carved into the ground here, both sides are steep earth
embankments. Hints of grass and trees sprout sporadically from the dirt, which
is otherwise lifeless. Most probably due to years of pollution from passing
vehicles.
