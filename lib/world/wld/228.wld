Name:	Entering Jason's Bar & Grill
Desc:$
   This relatively quiet and laid back bar and grill styled restaurant doesn't
seem to be the type for families, and instead, is geared more towards the
average slave wager and low-end suit looking to relax after a hard day of
work. Unlike other bars in the Casino Corner strip area, there is no loud
music blaring and pounding into the ear drums of its habituates, and instead
features live bands who are just as laid back as the clientele that visit it.

Name:	Passing by the stage
Desc:$
   A small stage is set up along the eastern wall for whatever live bands
happen to have been lined up for the night, which isn't as large or as decked
out as most of the other bars and clubs in the area. Fortunately, when
strolling past, one doesn't have to worry about having their ear drums bleed.
Groups of low level corps and slave wages can be seen enjoying their drinks
and meals at the various tables that are neatly scattered about the area.
Waitresses can be seen making their rounds, seeing to the needs of the
clientele to make sure they are satisfied.

Name:	Near the back of the restaurant
Desc:$
   This quiet section of the restaurant is tucked away from the stage and bar
area, making it perfect for those get togethers that don't need to be
interupted, or conversations that don't need to be held in the company of all
of the other habituates that frequent this place. Several private booths can
be seen set into the walls at the far side, offering even more privacy if it
is needed. Several widescreen trideo broadcasts have been set up for ease of
viewing, while others are specifically controlled by the tables they are
closest to.

Desc:$
   Rustic wood paneling and clean, dull tan and brown ceramic tiles set the
laid back tone for this private booth, which consists of little more than the
basic needs one could possibly ask for. Comfortable brown leather backed
seating and a wide synthwood table are flanked by two trideo sets, one for
each side to enjoy, and an adjustable lighting dial to set the mood. An RJ-685
datapoint is embedded into the far end of the table, just in case anyone needs
to jack in during their stay.

Name:	At the bar
Desc:$
   A lengthy synthwood bar spans a good portion of the area, most of which is
populated with grizzled types who are more interested in their drinks than
socializing, many of whom are kept in steady supply of their poison of choice.
The tenders manning the bar take orders and swiftly churn out the dishes
needed, while a stream of waitresses and hostesses mill back and forth to
deliver them to their particular tables and booths. Behind the bar is an open
double doorway that leads back into the kitchen, which is off-limits to all
but the highest quality of customers.

Name:	In a smokey kitchen
Desc:$
   Grills of all shapes and sizes dominate the majority of floor and wall
space here in the kitchen, which is manned by an equally large group of cooks
and grillers, who are struggling to keep up with the orders as they come
pouring in. Plumes of white smoke thick with the scent of cooking meat billows
up to the ceiling, which is quickly taken care of thanks to the heavily
modified system of blowers of vents, keeping the entire kitchen from becoming
a sauna of meat flavoured smoke.

   This freezer is packed full of all types of choice cuts and carcasses
hanging from steel hooks, and unlike most restaurants that prefer to serve
synthetic soy products and meat, it's clear to see from this inventory that
everything served here is 100% authentic, good old fashioned meat. The
temperature is kept at what feels below freezing, and even with the doors wide
open, the heavy machinery droning 24/7 keeps everything nice and cold. A small
staircase near the back leads into what one assumes is the basement, most
likely where the liquor is stored.

   Crates and barrels of all kinds are stacked and lined up along the walls
and floor, with small isles kept clear inbetween them for foot traffic. This
cool, temperature controlled room is, obviously, where all the beverages are
kept nice and chilled until they're needed for the tenders and clientele
upstairs. The occasional cobweb or two hangs down from the rafters above, but
for the most part the area is kept clean of the type of vermin that could ruin
the business. Near the far end of the southern edge of the basement is an open
doorway, which leads to who knows where.

Name:	Inside of a cement room
Desc:$
   This back room consists of plain cement flooring and walls, but unlike the
previous rooms, it doesn't seem it is meant for storage of any kind. Instead,
scuff marks from foot traffic cover a good portion of the floor, since
apparently this area sees quite a bit of it. An almost abrupt shift in scenery
is accompanied by a change in atmosphere as well, figuratively and literally,
the latter of which is thanks to the thick cigar smoke haze that lingers in
the air. Two doorways are set into opposite ends of the room, while another
smaller hallway stretches off along the original pathway.

before coming to a dead end. A large bookshelf takes up almost the entirety of
the eastern wall, which is completely barren of any books, and instead
contains only a few cobwebs and a thick layer of dust. Nothing of value or
interest can be seen on the walls or ceiling, no paintings, no lamps, and
aside from the bookshelf and a line of hanging bare bulbs for light, there is
nothing to see.

After close examination of the empty bookshelf, it becomes fairly apparent
that something is behind it. The faintest glimmer of light spills through the
small slits at its edges, and a good nudge shows it is hanging on some kind of
hinges. It is, however, very hard to move, as it is locked into place by some
means. A peculiar ^Whole^N the size of pencil is drilled into and through the wall
behind it, just below one of the shelves.

simple beaded chain pull string. Three doors are placed against the remaining
walls, the eastern one being the only one crafted from wood, while the
northern and southern doors are steel and seem to have several locks placed

lamps are posted in all four corners of the room, bathing it in a soft light
that is easy on the eyes, but still plentiful enough for paperwork and the
like.

Name:	The northwest corner
Desc:$
   Brushing elbows with the shadier portions of society seems to the be the
status quo here, minding ones own business is also heavily suggested, usually
by sidelong glances of beady eyes, or the occasional thumbing of holsters when
that doesn't get the job done. While most of the patrons heavily lean towards
the shadows, as always, a number of wannabes and posers managed to sneak their
way in and mingle, most of which are quickly isolated as outsiders and either
ignored, or threatened with gouged out eyes if they insist on not keeping
their gaze plastered on the ceiling or dance floor. The dance floor may be a
bit of a misnomer, considering most of the patrons have no intention of
putting it to use.

   The corner here is set up to offer as much privacy as possible with an open
space set up, which has its tables seperated just out of ear shot from one
another, thanks mostly to the sound system. The music here isn't too hard on
the ears for most folks tastes, and it isn't cranked up enough to cause
temporary (or permanent) deafness like some other clubs. A few of the shadier
types lingering in the crowd eyeball newcomers briefly, just to make sure
they're not sporting a badge, or worse, a camera.

   The dance floor here is all but empty, for reasons that are all too
apparent, considering the types of clietele this bar caters to. Various tables
and booths are set up in an almost random manner, seated at which are
metatypes of all shapes and shades, from big fugly trogs to snaggle tusked
orks, with a healthy dash of round-ears and even a fresh supply of grisly
dandelion eaters. The scent of booze, smoke and gunpowder is heavy in the air,
which goes right in tow with the scarred bodies and faces of the patrons
nearby.

   Habituates of every (meta)human type can be seen either enjoying their
drinks or discussing business, while others are relaxing and unwinding after
finishing up a job. There doesn't seem to be any distinct favourism or racist
in the establishment, mostly because those who work the shadows have better
things to bother with than such frivolous and trivial details. Instead, the
clientele seem more interested in who is a runner and who is just a wannabe or
poser. An occasional few are flagged as such, and are treated as if they were
carriers of the black death.

   Harsh glances from beady cybereyes greet anyone who passes by this section
of the bar, most of which belong to grizzled looking runners and mercenaries,
who would gladly slit your throat if there was a few nuyen for the task. Then
again, from the looks of it, quite a few of them would probably be more than
willing to do it for free, just to let you know they mean business. A few
dartboards grace the furthest eastern wall, which are covered with tiny pin
holes from constant use, having all but obliterated the numbers and colours
from its surface.

   Various tables and booths are set up and partitioned out of earshot, thanks
mostly due to the choice of music and other conversations that are taking
place amongst the clientele, making the need for whitenoise generators and
other such devices moot. Some of the highrollers are more noticable, thanks to
the heavily cybered bodyguards and other heavily armed members lingering near
their table or booth of business. Fights seem to be scarce, and for the most
part the habituates are more than happy to mind their own business and keep to
themselves, instead of risking a mob lynching at the hands of folks who would
rather this bar be kept nice and quiet for their own personal gain.

The decor consists mostly of synthwood and the occasional picture of various
runners and other patrons who are in some way vital to having made this
business venture successful. Some of which are noted with marker, noted mostly
as KIA, MIA or even less so, 'Retired', whatever that is supposed to mean.

Name:	The southeast corner
Desc:$
   This corner is tucked further away from the hustle and bustle one expects
from a bar, its ranks consisting of shady types who prefer to hug close to the
shadows. Outsiders are not welcome in the slightest, and most are handled by
the bar staff before ever being allowed in, granted, a few slip by here and
there, adding themselves to the droves of drunkards and relaxing runners.
Scuffed floor boards and mended furniture give the impression that more than a
fair share of fights, wether by the fist, blade or barrel, have gone down in
the past. The small holes in the surface of the ceiling can still attest to
that fact, and lead cores could probably be pried loose from them.

other noted memorabilia line the walls, along with such things as industry
awards and placement rankings, some of which are quite popular, while others
have been almost forgotten in less than a few months after their release.
Viewers are fickle, it seems.

Name:	Along the western promenade
Desc:$
   This half-circle promenade winds around the western side of Dadson Vision
Entertainments, allowing for a casual stroll around the perimeter of the
building. The scenery is one expected from a corporation that makes most of
its bank roll from simsense, trideo and cinema. Various movie posters and
other noted memorabilia line the walls, along with such things as industry
awards and placement rankings, some of which are quite popular, while others
have been almost forgotten in less than a few months after their release.
Viewers are fickle, it seems.

   This back room is beyond a locked door, which keeps out all of the general
traffic milling around the building, since apparently the words on the front
of it keep everyone capable of reading away. Several lines of higher end
simsense products can be found stored here, some of which are almost
straddling the line of legality in the UCAS. It also contains some other
software, some of which is more appropriate to non-beetle heads.

   An open-air front entrance greets guests and employees alike, sporting well

purposes, to blend more naturally into the idealized expectations of Everett
officials 'view' of the city, which has been slowly integrating and accepting
more corporate presence, under the terms they keep their property and
buildings alike from being eyesores to not only the natives, but tourists as

the desks features several MAD detectors and other security measures, while
the pathway continuing down along the hall is alive with activity. A large,
tasteful sign has been set up here, reading: ^WVISITOR'S AREA ->^N, making it
clear where those with appointments should be moving along to.

lit, allowing personel to view their labels clearly so mistakes are kept to a
minimum, while various clipboards with pens hanging from the on chains are
used to log interaction with the stock, just in case someone decides to walk
off with some of the corporations goods.

   This corridor smoothly curves off to the east as personel travel along it,
allowing security prime position to take up defensive points along its length,
just in case intruders infiltrate the compound. The red security stripe
continues down along the wall, while the ceiling is covered in odd looking
domes with sensors on them.
