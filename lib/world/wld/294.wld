Name:	Along Middlefield past the church
Desc:$
   Traveling down along Middlefield, the run-down and ramshackled buildings
that dot the landscape become fewer and fewer. The ganger presence that
permeates most of the barrens has been qwelled for some odd reason, and most
the graffiti and gang tags are almost non-existent towards this end of the
road. The lamp posts themselves have been broken, which isn't uncommon in a
place like this, but.. Theres an odd feeling in the air. An unmistakable
presence that gives anyone with any small bit of common sense the chills,
easily bringing hairs to stand on end as they travel down this dark and aptly
foreboding path.

Name:	A small turn in the road
Desc:$
   Beyond the subtle curves of the road, a gated cemetary begins to appear in
the distance. It begins becoming very apparent why there are so few squatters
and gangers down towards this end of Middlefield, and it certainly was because
of those Humanis chumps back at the church, since it appeared even they didn't
venture any closer to this place than the others. The smell of old death
creeps out, spreading and thickening the air, which would explain that uneasy
feeling in the pit of the stomachs of those either brave enough, or stupid
enough, to wander this close to such a place.

Name:	At the cemetary gates
Desc:$
   Large wrought iron gates, atleast a hundred or two years old, stand in
relative disrepair, acting as a marker for the point of no return. Aside from
the old mason work slabs of stone that form walls equally as old and just as
run down, the gate seems to be doing a wonderful job at keeping tresspassers
out, although it was doubtfully because of its solid construction. Beyond the
rusted and overgrown bars, one can make out the main pathway into the heart of
the cemetary, which is oddly dark and solemn, even during the brightest of
days. A spooky fog seems to be rolling around inside, just enough to conceal
most of which is hidden beyond the gates.

Name:	Entrance of the cemetary
Desc:$
   Whatever misconceptions or notions of an over active imagination one might
have had at the gates, is multiplied ten fold once you actually step foot
inside of the cemetary. An inch or two of fog covers the stone work pathway,
cutting through boots and offering travelers feet an unnatural chill that cuts
down to the bone. Various paths split off into the unusually dark depths in
each direction, while overhead the outstretched limbs of trees settled along
side of the paths claw out to blot out both the sun and moonlight equally. The
stillness of the air is only occasionally broken by an abrupt, yet gentle
breeze, while the sounds of shuffling and what can only be described as
whispers echo through the cemetary.. But surely, thats just your imagination..
Right?

Name:	Before the angel statue
Desc:$
   In the center of this small clearing, the stone and gravel pathways
converge at the feet of a beautifully crafted marble angel, most likely a
grave marker for some affluent or important person. Foliage of various sorts
has clawed and climbed its way up along its form, and now its limbs are mostly
covered in hanging mosses and splotchy sections of mold. A presence can be
felt here, but it is unlike the others to be felt around this graveyard. It
feels.. comfortable? Welcoming, perhaps even warm, or at the least, warmer
than one would expect, considering the scenery. The fog is kept at bay by some
unseen force, even though all logic says it the area should be swamped with
it, since there is a slight decline down in the earth leading up to it.

Name:	Stumbling across cobblestones
Desc:$
   Smoothly polished cobblestones, now loosely fitted due to the vegetation
attempting to pry them apart as they break up through the earth beneath, have
altered and warped the landscape to quite a degree. Keeping a steady footing
isn't an easy task here, no thanks to the thicket of fog that blankets the
area, keeping travelers from seeing what is infront of them before taking each
step. The shifting of the cobblestones break the silence every now and then,
and what follows inbetween is stark stillness, where the only real sound to be
heard is ones own heartbeat. A small shack of some sort, almost falling in on
itself, stands on the northern edge of the path here.

Name:	Along the western foot path
Desc:$
   The western foot path consists of loose gravel, with masses of graves and
headstones adorning the sides of it. The gnarled branches of large trees
covering most of the southern edge along the outer cemetary wall stretch out
across the path, and in some places, dip and sway down to snag at clothing in
an almost intelligent, malicious manner. You must be imagining it, ofcourse,
because they're just trees afterall... Its not like they're out to get you..
Ofcourse not? The occasional hoot of an owl echoes through the branches,
breaking the calm stillness of the perpetual darkness and somber atmosphere.

Name:	A dark stretch on the gravel pathway
Desc:$
   This stretch of the loose gravel foot path is almost overwhelmed from
above, since the tree branches that were only an occasional nuisance were now
attempting to block any traffic that tries to make its way through the area.
Darkness seems to have fallen over this section in particular, most likely due
to the amount of overhanging branches, but it would be easy to let ones
imagination wander into an area of uncomfortable thoughts. The branches creak
and click together, offering faint snapping and popping noises while they rub
together and sway in the wind, scattering all sorts of shadows that are just
begging to play tricks on the eye. Then again.. perhaps they aren't tricks at
all.

Desc:$
   Scattered in an almost random array along each side of this loose gravel
footpath are multitudes of graves. Almost all of them are overgrown with
vegetation to some extent, but most manage to peer up from beneath to make
themselves known to the word. Some are little more than stone markers, while
others are beautifully etched and carved with decorations, but one thing is
the same, regardless of their design. The elements have no been kind, and
sitting out in the weather with little upkeep have taken their toll, rendering
their text obscured with dirt and grime, the likes of which would have to be
clawed and peeled away to be read.

Name:	Continuing along the eastern path
Desc:$
   The loose gravel pathway continues along, each step crunching and shifting
beneath the weight of them. The fog here here is thick, and cold to the touch,
making it hard to see even a few feet beyond where you're standing. The
pathway itself looks to break off and head west, as well as continuing along
its journey to the north. A few broken headstones have been toppled, either
due to lack of upkeep, or intentionally.. its hard to tell. Their moss and
mold covered surfaces reflect this neglect, as well as bearing strange
markings, four thin striations seperated almost equally apart.. about as far
as apart as ones fingers are. Odd.

Desc:$
   A set of foot paths converge infront of several sets of masterfully
constructed and decorated masoleums, which one can only hope are empty and
devoid of anything still capable of movement. The masoleum directly to the
north has seen better days, and one of the larger grave marker stones has
collapsed and fallen against its gated front section, sealing it off to any
would be grave robbers. The slab of stone itself would prove to be an
impossible task to move, even for even the largest of metahumans, and short of
a backhoe or crane, it doesn't look like its going anywhere any time soon. The
small bushes and shrubs dotting the sides of the paths here often shake and
shudder as if something was moving through them.. but obviously, it has to be
harmless wildlife.

   The cobblestone foot path quickly gives way to loose gravel, although its
hard to tell without a good long look down, since the treacherous footing both
offer is quite the same. A pair of masoleums crafted from what was probably
once marble, now darkened and covered with overgrowth of plantlife, stand as
monuments to the deceased who are contained within.. Or, at the least, one can
only hope they have passed over to the other side. The eastern masoleum
doesn't seem readily accessible, but the one standing directly to the north
has an iron gate covering its front. An old, rusted padlock lies in shambles
at the foot of its steps, along with a few tangled and broken set of
chainlinks that held it closed at one point.

   All of the pathways the converge here now move along into a single,
solitary line of smoothly polished slabs of stone, heading off towards the
north, down an increasingly darker tunnel of trees and bushes that spring up
from the ground and envelope it on both sides. If one felt uneasy traveling
down the foot paths that led here, this one in particular was sure to test
their meddle. The movement of plants and the whisperings that echo through the
trees on either side is unsettling, to say the least, and the fog is rolling
in as thick as anywhere before.

Desc:$
   Traveling along this pathway is sure to make even the most brave of
adventurers atleast a bit uneasy. The trees and bushes on each side have
closed in, almost threatening to over take the path itself, slimming the foot
traffic down into a tunnel like construction. Little to no light, wether it be
provided by the sun or moon, seems to filter in from above, adding to its
creepy, dark atmosphere quite a deal. The fog here is almost waist high, and
has to be waded through like some ice cold river crossing. The soft sound of
water lapping against the earth can be heard faintly to the west, beyond the
thicket of gnarled bushes and trees.

Name:	At the weeping willow tree
Desc:$
   Struggling free from the tangles of trees and branches that reach out and
claw at travelers that make their way through these sections of pathways,
suddenly come to a clearing in the center of the cemetary. There are no graves
in the immediate area, and instead, almost everything has been cleared away
from this dark glade. Lush, wet grass covers most of the ground that leads up
to what stands in the center of the clearing, almost as if in testament to the
creepy nature of the graveyard scenery. A single, massive weeping willow tree
dominates the landscape, its tendril like limbs stretching out and draping
down, though all are devoid of flowering buds. As if to add to the uneasiness
one might feel, it looks like someone has tossed a length of rope across one
of its lower branches, its end knotted and tied into a noose... Comforting.
Infront of the tree is a large slab of stone, perhaps an inch or two thick,
and a meter or so wide, acting as a plaque of some kind.

Name:	Along a dirt path
Desc:$
   A set of stone work masoleums are set off to the northern edge of this
mostly compacted dirt pathway, acting as markers for travelers as they journey
their way deeper into the heart of this god forsaken cemetary. Stone markers
of all sorts pop up and appear as one moves along through the terrain, some
hidden by overgrowth, while others have been knocked over or had debris piled
up to obscure their positions. The dirt path itself twists and turns as it
navigates its way through these headstones, and if one is not careful,
tripping over them is certainly a possibility. The old iron gates set on the
front of the stone buildings creak and groan as the wind catches their
surfaces, which is sure to send chills down the spines of those with weaker
constitutions.

   Various routes converge infront of this particular masoleum, crafted from
marble which has long since become darkened, its surfaces refusing to reflect
light as they did during their first few years of life. The gate set into the
front section of the above ground crypt has come loose from its latching
fixtures, and now sits lopsidedly. Although, if one cared enough to attempt
it, they just might be able to pry it loose and climb inside for a bit of
grave robbing.. that is, if they're brave enough to do so. The fork in the
path travels off and away from the others, heading off towards the northwest.

   From here, it would almost seem as if you're headed deeper into a forest,
since it was becoming harder and harder to make out the scenery on either
sides of the path. The trees weren't just overgrown, they seemed to be
intentionally trying to block off the route uphill towards the north, and it
would take quite a bit of effort to swim through the masses of branches and
vines that drape down across the foot path. Fortunately, the fog seems to be
letting up, and it isn't quite as thick as it was down below. Things are
definately looking up... Right?

   This stretch of cemetary is free of the usual gravemarkers that seem to be
dotting most of the scenery down at the foot of the hill, and instead, has
been set aside from the others. The plots most likely belonged to those
wealthy enough to afford such ammeneties, since even in death, it seemed nuyen
reigns supreme. One of several masoleums are set off to the western edge,
since to the east the hill drops off into a bog like pond surrounded by
thickets of trees draped with tendrils of vines and hanging moss. The path
itself continues up along the hill to the north.

to the west, while the eastern edge is covered in masses of trees and other
wild plantlife, growing out of control, and in some places, spilling over onto

Desc:$
   The hillside has been excavated here to allow for these masoleums to be
built, and at one point, the view from up here was probably pretty nice.
However, thats no longer the case, as can be seen from this vantage point. The
mixture of unkempt tree growth and the pooling of water down below in the
sinkhole pond has turned this place into a mixture of swampland and forest.
The fact that its a cemetary doesn't exactly help out, and at this point even
the god awful stench and scenery of the barrens would be a welcome sight for
sore eyes. Another masoleum dots the hill before the pathway begins winding
down along its southwestern side, heading off down towards another plot
seperated from the main section of graves.

Name:	Climbing the cemetary hill
Desc:$
   Traveling up along a fairly steep incline, the gravel gives way to stepped
platforms of stone, which help make the climb a bit easier. The higher up one
goes, the more of the cemetary can be made out below. Unfortunately, its looks
even creepier from here than it did while originally passing through. The
rolling banks of fog can be seen bubbling up from a secluded pond to the
south, but it doesn't look readily accessible, especially not from this end.
Several more stone masoleums line the top edge of the hill, offering more
opportunities for graverobbing.

   This small stretch of gravel strewn pathway is free of the usual gravestone
markers that dot the landscape almost everywhere else. Instead, only a few
choice plots of land have taken up residence here, taking form of intricately
designed and constructed masoleums. The above ground crypts help to keep the
ravages of nature from prematurely destroying their grave markings, and also
help to keep things such as animals (and metahumans) from tampering with or
disturbing their final resting places. Two distinctly ornate masoleums stand
on this plot, on to the north, while another stands off to the east of here.

   This shortened foot path ends abruptly at the eastern wall of the cemetary,
its stone walls higher along its side than it was in the front, most likely to
help keep tresspassers and graverobbers from easily scaling. This plot is set
away from the others, seperated by small thickets of trees and bushes, which
surround the masoleums on each aside apart from the pathway that led to them.
The eastern masoleum looks a little worse for wear, and its front gate is
broken almost entirely off of its hinges, the marks on its stone face the tell
tale workings of the crowbar that was used to pry it open.

Vines and hanging mosses have clawed their way in through the walls and

Half-rotten planks of wood make up what were once floor boards, but have been

feet. The smell of decay is heavy in the air here, even moreso than the

bit of light spills in from the holes in the roof, casting shadows and making
things appear to shift and move, but its most likely just a trick on the

you wanna scrape up some bat droppings and sell it as alternative fuel.

Name:	Inside a dirty little crypt
Desc:$
   Someone has obviously taken up residence within this particular crypt, as
the makeshift bed cobbled together from a stained futon stuffed with old
newspaper parked against the far wall may attest to. A small hand-held radio
sits off in a corner, as well as a quite broken portable trid, obviously
battery powered considering the location. The floor infront of the makeshift
bedding is practically caked with dirt and quite a deal of blood (not to
mention some grisly little bits you don't wanna check too closely), along with
an occasional tangled mess of animal fur or what looks to be metahuman hair.

Name:	Inside a crypt caked with gore
Desc:$
   While this crypt may have been quite beautiful back in its hay day, that
time has certainly passed. A mixture of dirt, grime and blood is spattered
across the stone floor slabs, and the coffin itself is nowhere to be found. In
its place there are a few old dirty futons that even a drunken hobo wouldn't
dare sleep on, most of their surfaces being either caked or downright
slathered with a gorey substance. A few fingernails adorn the edges of the
front entrance, as if someone had attempted to claw their way out, only to
have them wrenched from the tips of their fingers, leaving behind smeared
streaks of fingers traveling along the floor and walls nearby. Its probably
best not to dwell too deeply on what has transpired in this crypt.

Desc:$
   Aside from the bits and pieces of trash and other unmentionables scattered
across its surfaces, this crypt is in relatively good shape, especially when
compared to the others. The stone coffin is still intact, for starters, and
damages to the stone relief work decorating the corners and walls are minimal.
A few bits and pieces of blood caked fur and feathers can be found in clumps
on the floor, the remains of someone, or somethings, latest meals perhaps? A
few handprints are smeared along the edge of the coffins lid, a mixture of
blood and dirt from the looks of it.

Name:	Inside of a ransacked crypt
Desc:$
   Lavish. Thats the word that would have been used, perhaps years ago when
this crypt was first constructed. Its just a mere shadow of its former glory
these days, since damn near everything has been either broken, ripped off at
its base, or completely stolen. Cracked and uneven sections of stone show
where small statues originally were, and in some cases, their bases are still
intact. Someone obviously went to town on this place with a pry bar, as its
markings are scratched along anywhere it could fit in an attempt to claw off
something to steal away and pawn. The coffin lid is over turned and broken
into many pieces, while the lining and base of it are just as bad, consisting
mostly of ragged slivers and slabs scattered about on the floor.

Desc:$
   After wading through and pushing aside low hanging branches, the terrain
opens up, albeit only slightly. There seems to be a patch of land pushing
itself up above the surface of the pond, which, by the looks of it, was an old
portion of the cemetary that has long since been flooded and overgrown.
Stained and grimey gravestone markers pop up from beneath a layer of rotten
leaves, scattered evenly about the little island. In the center of the island,
on its highest point, stands a large marble monument, towering above and
inbetween branches, atleast several meters in height, and a meter or two at
the base. There is a silence about this place, aside from the occasional sound
of the water in its surroundings, there doesn't seem to be any active wildlife
on this little patch of land, and the fog itself doesn't touch its shores for
some odd reason.

spills down off onto the floor. A few striations and marks of something being

Desc:$
   The only thing of remote interest along this stretch of tunnel, aside from
the funky smell and lack of suitable lighting, is the large hole in the
eastern wall. It looks as if someone cracked the concrete foundation and kept
on going, clawing out chunks of broken rock and dirt, widening it until it
could serve as passage for most normal sized metahumans. A lot of the debris
has been piled up on either side of the hole, keeping the spillways from
clogging up and becoming an even bigger issue, while still allowing for
traffic in and out of the main tunnel.

which is where the spill-way pours all of its content into a lower section of
collection tunnels and the like. A group of pipes sticks down out of the
ceiling and hugs along it, eventually curving and dipping downward to run down
the length of the far wall. There doesn't look to be any service ladders, or
any way of getting down aside from perhaps sliding down one of the dirty and
slime covered pipes, making any travel along them treacherous at best.

   The tunnel begins to turn off, slowly and subtly at first, until it becomes
more and more apparent of a bend. Almost every inch of the concrete surfaces
are covered with grime, and the pipes sticking out of the walls show signs of
years and years of neglect, lending to the assumption that this place hasn't
seen any action in quite a while. There seems to be quite a bit of dried and
caked dirt along the central walkway, which apparently sees its fair share of
traffic. Why whom? Well, sometimes you're better off not knowing.

itself stretches off towards the south, while two smaller holes have been
broken away on either sides of the wall, punched out to make room for tunnels

   An old metal ladder is loosely bolted into what looks to be a stretch of
cement wall, which wobbles and shakes whenever any weight is shifted on it,
and a few of the rungs have all but rusted into nothingness at this point. The
grimey cement wall and ceiling in this portion of underground seems consistent
with an old drainage system, probably to keep the graves from getting flooded.
However, there seems to be little in the way of water flow, aside from an
occasional trickle of run-off spilling in from the cracks in the covering
above. The cement casing seems to continue its journey along to the south a
ways before being engulfed by darkness.

of the now narrowing foot path. Eventually it winds its way along to the mouth
of a hole in the wall, beyond which looks to be man made constructions of

blocks of stone poking out.

Pieces of plywood and lengths of two by fours have been nailed together in an
attempt to patch up some sections of the collapsing walls and floor, and in
some places it has completely rotted through in places, making it a landmine
situation when crossing. One false step and.. well, best not to find out?

Name:	Approaching a blind turn
Desc:$
   This portion of the underground tunnel has seen its fair share of traffic,
as the numerous sets of overlaying foot prints and scuff marks of both boots
and bare feet mar the floor. A bit of plywood and the occasional two by four
is pressed and driven up against the walls and ceiling to help reinforce and
keep particular portions from collapsing, which seems to be doing its job
rather well, considering the tunnel is still intact. This end of a blind turn
can be seen further off the northwest, while off to the south an occasional
bit of debris and pebbles can be heard tumbling down into the tunnels.

Name:	Down into the unknown
Desc:$
   The cracked and broken stones above jut out to line the descent down this
little hole in the ground, offering limited hand and foot holds for anyone
brave (or stupid) enough to venture down here. The walls are covered in
half-cut and frayed roots that were chopped away during excavation, which are
now attempting to grow back into place. The floor is slightly compacted, but
still loose enough to leave foot prints in, many of which still haven't been
worn away from weathering, showing signs of quite a deal of movement through
this particular section of the underground.

Name:	The bottom of a rough climb
Desc:$
   Murky droplets of water spill down from the rock ledges above, which are
scattered about along each side of the walls, jutting out to offer slippery
hand and foot holds for anyone brave enough to attempt the climb. An inch or
two of watery mud has collected along the center of this section of tunnel,
which runs off and travels down a subtle incline towards the southeast. The
sound of water dripping echoes through-out the chamber, making it hard to hear
anything beyond this section.

Name:	Climbing over dirt mounds
Desc:$
   The loose dirt walls and ceiling here threatens to collapse, and even has
in some places, spilling down to create uneven mounds that have to be climbed
over. Small holes, some more than large enough to snag a foot, dot the
landscape inbetween the piles of dirt, threatening to break the ankles of
anyone foolish enough not to take care in their journey. There is practically
no light to speak of down here, and aside from the faint glow further along
towards the southeast, no lamps or light fixtures are to be found.

Name:	At an underground crossroad
Desc:$
   While originally a dead end section of the tunnel system, the walls on
either side have been broken through and excavated quite a deal, more than
enough to offer passage to anyone wanting to do a bit of crawling and
climbing. Off to the south the concrete tunnel itself continues, lined with
old rusted metal pipes of all shapes and sizes, while the holes leading off
from it are little more than loose dirt and jagged rocks.

Name:	Amongst a variety of pipes
Desc:$
   An assortment of various sized pipes drape down from the ceiling and along
the walls, most of which delve down into the floor, which consists mostly of
metal grating, allowing small glimpses of what lies under foot. The sound of
water spilling from pipes and being collected from run-off can be heard
splashing and dripping down below, while a service tunnel of some sort expands
out around near their base. It looks as if the pipes could be climbed back up
to the section above, while the only other means of travel seem to be off to
the north, where the small section of service tunnel stretches off to before
forking off in different directions.

Name:	Before a busted doorway
Desc:$
   The walls in this short section of tunnel is composed mostly of dirt, which
has been compacted and pressed tightly into place inbetween lines of wooden
posts spaced every meter or so, to keep the ceiling and walls from caving in
on itself. A busted little wooden door, constructed mostly with rusty nails
and thin sheets of scrap wood, is held in place by a makeshift metal latch and
a long, bent nail. Small slivers of light spill through the cracks of the
door, since apparently there seems to be some form of lightsource on the other
side. Even with all the cracks, none are particularly wide enough to peer
through.

   The walls here consist of little more than compacted dirt, with beams of
wood crossing along their length, as well as the ceiling, with slats of metal
nailed and screwed together in a mix-mash of construction. Several wooden
tables, mostly old picnic benches and lengths of wood stacked ontop of
cinderblocks to create and extend their sections, creating a veritable
assortment of places to settle down for a meal. Most of the tables, and even
the floor, have old dried blood marks smeared across their surfaces, as well
as quite a few marks, made by something or someone clawing their nails across
them.

Desc:$
   This is obivously a storage area of some kind, indicated by the masses of
half-rotten crates and boxes that are stacked across its expanse. A small
gasoline generator is stuffed into one of the corners, with cords and wires
twisting their way across the dirt floor off towards several large metallic
containers, powering whatever contents are located inside. A small crack in
one of them has a fog like mixture spilling out, frosting its surface with
ice.. cryo-freezers perhaps? An almost indiscernable hole in the roof can be
noted with a bit of searching, and aside from the possibility of clawing ones
way back up through the dirt above, quite a task as it may seem, the only
other exit is a shoddy wooden doorway, consisting of little more than a few
two by fours and plywood nailed together and hung on rusty hinges.
