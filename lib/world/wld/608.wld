Name:	Parking Lot
Desc:$
   A sun-bleached slab of concrete is all that remains of the lot where St.
Boniface's staff and visitors used to park their vehicles. It's mostly vacant
now, save for a few derelict and burnt-out relics which have been picked clean
by scavengers. Vegetation pokes through the concrete, and the outer edges of
the lot have begun to crack and slide away with the hill's erosion. Another
century and perhaps the crumbling hilltop will reach the building itself, but
there doesn't seem to be any action from the corporates or government to deal
with the problem. Everyone seems to be content to let the derelict building
rot.
   St. Boniface's looms from your east, stretching north and continues west,
like a semi-closed hand eager to wrap itself around you. To the north is the
entrance.

Name:	The front doors
Desc:$
   The building looms over you, an immense wall of broken windows and rusted
steel grating, suffocated by weeds. Tendrils of dried ivy creep around an old
metal sign bolted on the bricking and reads: "St. Boniface Shelter for the
Persecuted and Maligned. EST 2021". History recalls that after Goblinization
Day most of the people who had survived UGE had suffered from severe mental
and emotional trauma. St. Boniface was created by the Seattle government to
offer a place of shelter for those most tortured by their experiences, as well
as for the safety of the populace at large. The organisation created to govern
and run St. Boniface, the Seattle Council for Abhorrent Behaviour, or SCAB,
had many financial backers, including corporate sponsors who funded the
building of the asylum atop a prominent hill on Seattle's outskirts.

Name:	Foyer
Desc:$
You are standing in a large circular room, the dome high above you shrouded in darkness. This was the foyer of St. Boniface's, with its high sloping walls and murals of angels and nature scenes, now defaced. In the center of the foyer, a large empty water fountain quietly sits, rusting. Trash  litters the floor and a dripping sound can be heard from somewhere overhead.
Despite the careful wording, St. Boniface was in fact a mental institution for those rendered insane by goblinization. Unfortunately, it soon became nothing more than a dumping ground for hundreds of society's newly-mutated breeds, and the mounting operational costs forced the government to sell the institution, handing ownership over to the corporate-backed SCAB.
In answer to the increasing 'problem' of UGE, SCAB was later discovered to have attempted to 'cure' its patients of their physical afflictions by performing horrendeous acts of physical and mental abuse.
After a few internal riots and several protests by civil-action groups, SCAB was able to avoid criminal persecution (thanks to a few large campaign contributions to influential statesmen), eventually shutting down the asylum in 2048.
The surviving patients of St. Boniface were given monetary compensation and released.

To the north are the Administrative offices. The Women's ward begins to the east and the Men's ward lies to the west. Some apartments are to the southeast.

   This large room is where the matrons who staffed the Women's Ward lived,
easily housing over forty women who worked around a two-day shift. Given the
apartments' close proximity to the main exit of St. Boniface's, most of the
female staff that lived here were able to escape the calamitous riots that
occurred within the facility. The yellowed linoleum tiles have mostly peeled
off, revealing several holes and rotting wood subfloors. Dozens of skeletal
bunk frames have been piled up against the southern wall, completely blocking
the windows and looking more like the twisted intestinal tract of some massive
metallic creature.

Name:	24-Bedded Rooms
Desc:$
   These large communal rooms once housed those less afflicted by their UGE
experiences, and served as a place to hide away society's undesireable
metavariants rather than the clinically insane. Conflict between patients was
a problem, especially when the corporates took control of St. Boniface. As a
result, special tanks full of tear gas were installed alongside the facility's
fire-extinquishing pipes, allowing for a quick and easy method of controlling
flaring tempers.
   Graffiti artists have left a few tags here and there. Most of the paint on
the walls has started to peel, giving one the impression of looking at the
skin of a shedding snake. Broken window panes along the south wall let in
plenty of sunlight or moonlight, depending on the time of day.

   You are once again outside, standing in an enclosed courtyard at the rear
of St. Boniface. The cracked sidewalk at your feet was once used to roll out
patients in wheelchairs who were either non-responsive or simply too weak to
move about on their own. Patients who were equally disabled and considered
problematic were sometimes wheeled out and left here for hours - sometimes
days - on end.
   The lawn is now choked with weeds and debris lies scattered about the
courtyard. Along the fence to the west is a large pile of empty spray paint
cans.

Name:	Male Washrooms
Desc:$
   Given the St. Boniface's need to constantly monitor patients at all times,
modesty was not granted to those admitted to the facility. A row of dingy
toilets line the west wall, with not partitions to seperate them. One of the
toilets has overflowed, spilling sewage refuse across the cracked concrete
floor. In the center is a large circular urinal with a non-functional
foot-operated flushing mechanism.
   The sharp stink in this room testifies that it is still used by the
occasional scavengers, thrill-seekers and homeless that still haunt St.
Boniface's halls. The sinks to the east were also foot-operated with large
slabs of polished metal hanging above that served as mirrors.

up in one corner where a tangle of old hoses now lies, cracked and useless.
   Given that most of the patients weren't cognitive enough to comprehend, let
alone be bothered with hygiene, they were taken here on a rotating basis to be
cleansed and washed. The corporate solution to the problem was a bit more
direct: line the patients against the far wall and hose them down, usually
with the water pressure turned up way too high.

   There seems to have been a fire here. The blackened metal counters, now
covered with trash and animal scat, have begun to rust away. An old stove and
refrigerator seem half-melted by whatever conflagration that occurred here,
and the weakened support structures have caused the cabinets to collapse in
some areas, adding to the detritus. Against the north wall, barely perceptible
through the soot, pegs in the tiled wall show where kitchen utensils were
hung.
   During St. Boniface's operation, someone sprayed the walls with paint as
the utensils were still hanging there, leaving the silouette of each tool in
its place. This was to facilitate the detection of missing kitchen implements
by patients who often stole kitchenware for more sinister purposes.

   At first-glance this building seems to have been a storage area, but the
remnants of several display cases - all smashed now - indicate that it served
as some sort of internal business venue. Indeed, another reward for compliancy
and good behavior was the use of non-monetary credits. A patient who had
accrued enough credits could use them to buy small perishable items here.
   The room now lies in tatters with most of its shelving units smashed or
toppled and is strewn with debris. A engraved plaque of wood hangs
precariously on a single nail with a faded list of items that were available.
Barely discernable are such items as cigarettes (4 credits), soap (5 credits),

Desc:$
   Patients with a means of financial aid, such as the wealthy or those with
enough influence, were housed here in semi-private rooms, though the care they
received was no better than their fellow inmates. Today, these rooms are bare,
devoid of any large pieces of furniture. In one of them, an empty metal drum
appears to have served as a firepit for some individuals eager to find solace
from a cold night's chill. The grated windows needlessly look out upon the
sky.

fresh air. The ground is now thick with crumbling mortar and choking weeks. At
the far end, near the twisted chain-link fence, an old flat gurney with a
black mattress lies on its side, its wheels wrapped in barbed wire.

   A nurses' station precedes the way west, followed by what may have been a
checkpoint, complete with built-in metal detector. The device's electrical
wirings have been ripped out, and it looks like someone tried to start a fire
within its mechanical housing. A stack of clip-boards lies in the corner,
half-buried by dust and the paint peeling off the decaying walls looks like
strips of rags.
   Overhead, a single fluorescent lamp flickers dimly, testament to the latent
power still seeping throughout St. Boniface.

clinical interviews of their patients. Now, the once-plush desks and furniture
are in ruin, with a chesterfield looking like it's been cut in half by a
chainsaw and the empty filing cabinet that has been used for target practice.
What little there remains of the wallpaper has faded and dried to the point of
being brittle, looking more like wrinkled skin.
   Directly across a desk is an old metallic chair, twisted and rusted but
still bolted in place, with iron rings fastened to the floor, testament to the
precautions taken with some of the patients.
   A very old elevator door, no longer functional, lies to the west.

on the dusty shelves offers such titles as; "Freud's Folly", "2021: Humanity
at a Crossroads?", "Cognitive and Societive Disorders within the Humanis
Ingentis Genome" and "Evolution: the New Faces of Evil". The ensuing

Name:	Solitary Rooms
Desc:$
   These dark rooms are no more than a few meters square with a high ceiling.
Their doors rest on stout metallic hinges. The pink and yellow padding lining
their walls has mostly rotted away, leaving bare the cold and pitted concrete
beyond. There are no windows here, though the stench of copper is pervasive.
In white chalk, someone has managed to write on the exposed concrete, "Darwin
es correcto".
   Given the high propensity for violence from some of UGE's sufferers,
St.Boniface made full use of these 'punative segregation' rooms, sometimes
donning their patients further in sensory-deprivation attire. The asylum's
physicians got mixed results, depending on how long they could keep inmates
locked up in these rooms.
   An old pair of red children's shoes lies within one of the cells.

such as the use of the solitary confinement rooms.

   Rows of metal shelving, bare but for the dust and rat droppings, are lined

maze-like quality, and in one of the corners a pile of old metal filing
cabinets have be halfhazardly stacked, leaving most of their paper contents

personal effects such as clothing, seperated by age and size. Posters and
drawings on the wall promote personal hygiene, geared towards the female

   St. Boniface's patients were given credits for good behaviour which were in
turn redeemed here for supplies, from bars of soaps to tampons to new shoes.
The SCAB staff was rumored to have once purposely given a female ork patient
two left shoes as part of a pair. This so distraught the severely emotionally
disturbed woman that she later committed suicide.

Name:	4-Bedded Rooms
Desc:$
   A series of semi-private rooms where the more docile patients were allowed
to live (as well as those with monetary influence). Each room has a single
window through which the protective grating casts a long shadow, echoing the
dark corners and places beneath the long-abandoned hospital beds. Many of the
dormitories still have the patients' name tags upon the doors.
   In one of the rooms is an old metallic Attica crib, which is an enclosed
bed where patients were encaged to prevent them from falling out and hurting
themselves, or others.

Name:	Female Airing Courts
Desc:$
   An area open to the sky, but surrounded by a two-meter high brick wall that
is blackened with grime and dust. The cracked concrete is covered with dead
leaves, and the patches of grass have long-ago been overrun by weeds. Once,
this is where the more compliant and ambulatory patients were allowed to get
some fresh air, but the rusted barbed-wire spools atop the wall were grisly
reminders of exactly what the asylum was all about. A few graffitic tags are
on the wall and several broken bottles of beer are scattered here and there.

   The physicians in attendance conducted most of their research and
interviews of patients in these posh offices. The wallpapered walls and
stately furniture, however, are in ruin, with graffitic tags and burners
hiding the faded wall decors and the remaining desks having been hacked at
with various sharp tools. The labels for some of the now-empty desk drawers
read: "foot cuffs", and "wrist restraints". A very stately red chair lies here
on its side, its cushioning slashed repeatedly.

corner, all ruined and useless. Boxes and boxes of old software packages lie
half-decomposed under the cracked windows. On the water-stained wall, a clean
circular silouette amidst the rotting black wallpaper indicates where a clock
most likely once hung. A note on a pegboard keeps track of peer-to-peer
aggression and client-to-staff injuries that occurred up until the asylum's
closing.

   The Women's Isolation Ward of St.Boniface was initially reserved for those
patients deemed too dangerous to themselves or others. Of course, when SCAB
took the mantle of ownership, the IsoWard was also used as punishment for any
slight, whether real or imagined, done to the staff. The dark hall is narrow,
with its high ceiling hidden within shadows. Rows of thick metal doors line
the walls, almost daring you to enter.

everything in the room just by peering in through the thick metal door's
observation slits.
   The light filtering through the dusty double-grated window panes is
softened, basking these cells in pale light rather than the usual bright sheen
of day, and causing the shadows to encroach closer.

even a small rusted weight scale.
   The remains of many computer motherboards and other circuitry are scattered
about, but a lone flatscreen mounted within the wall is still on and casting a
soft green light. A yellowed index card is still pinned by the door, noting
the location of several pieces of equipment, notably the emergency drug box,
portable oxygen, resuscitator, IV equipment and suture set.

   As well as give the patients of St. Boniface a place to immerse themselves
in a natural surrounding, the asylum attempted to grow some of its own organic
food to help curb costs.  When SCAB and its corporate backers took over,
however, this part of the property was simply abandoned and left to go fowl.
The field now has several large bushes and small trees marring its straight
orderly rows underwhich weeds and creeping ivy fight a never-ending battle
against waves of urban trash and detritus from the crumbling asylum.

succumbed to their mental illnesses or suffered from too much trauma as part
of their UGE experience were buried when they died. Families, too ashamed of
their deceased relatives' transformations, were usually content to have a
number rather than the patient's name put on the stone.
   Many markers are askew, as well as sunken in or pushed up.

fluorescent light overhead stutters and buzzes, casting ugly dead colors
about.
   Along with the newly-awakened, individuals were sent to St. Boniface
because they had suddenly sprouted latent magical abilities that were as yet
uncontrolled, and hence considered a hazard. Others who had managed a small
grasp of their new abilities were deemed even more of a threat. As a cure,
SCAB's corporate backers suggested the use of mage masks. These were
tight-fitting, eyeless masks that had a breathing tube shoved down the mage's
throat and speakers over the ears that pumped over 90dB of white noise, thus
making the individual incapable of concentrating, and therefore unable to cast
any spells. Prologned exposure to these masks often drove the wearers insane.

Name:	Hydrotherapy room
Desc:$
   Cobwebs and steel support struts frame a huge tank of water, with a winding
catwalk leading to its top. The vat itself is made from semi-transparent
plasfab pieces banded together with iron casings. The remaining water within
the tank is black and thick, with nothing disturbing its surface.
   With the success of hydrotherapy to alleviate arthritic pain, St. Boniface
attempted to mirror the soothing effects of warm water upon its metavariant
patients. Of course, given the severity of mental problems, the asylum's
physicians concluded that one merely needed to turn up the heat considerably,
hoping that an increaseof blood flow, oxygen and nutrients would speed the
elimination of toxins in the bloodstream. Patients came to refer to this
practice as 'deep-frying'.

Desc:$
   Dank and dark, the concrete floor has cracked here with some brown liquid
filling up the gaps and causing the room to reek. Several old x-ray viewing
panes still line the far wall of this room, and the tiled walls have beads of
rusty-brown water on them. Abandoned X-Ray films,  an operating chassis and
chemicals from Kodak and 3M are scattered about.

Name:	Morgue
Desc:$
   A series of small metal doors line the east wall. Most of them have been
opened and the wheeled slabs within pulled completely out. The paint on the
ceiling is peeling in great sheets, giving the appearance of looking like
drapes hanging precariously overhead, and clumps of white powder are spread
across the pink-tiled floor. The air here is moist and the smell of burnt hair
is pervasive.
