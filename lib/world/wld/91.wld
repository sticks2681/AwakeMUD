Name:	Entrance to Quinn's
Desc:$
   The entrance to Quinn's looks like your average nightclub.  A hardy bouncer

   As you walk into this room you are slightly taken aback by the furnishings.
In one corner is a wheel, three meters in diameter, that has marks on it from
what look like throwing knives and four clasps: two for wrists and two for
ankles. In the other corner is a device that somewhat resembles a sawhorse.
Ankle straps are on one side of the base and the other side hold wrist straps
to incapacitate the participant while they are being tortured. The west wall
hold various tools of torture, from spiked wheels and paddles, to more exotic
things you can't determine the purpose of.

   As you are flung over the edge of the falls you see a beautiful scene. A
sparkling lake surrounded by huge redwoods stretches out below you. In the sky
eagles soar and you even think you can see a few fish leaping into the air
catching insects. As you take in the peaceful surroundings your body is
smashed into the rocks at the misty bottom of the falls. Fortunately you are
broken into pieces before the piranhas get to your fresh corpse.

   The clifface is essentially vertical. You can barely keep your grip on the
near razor-sharp rocks that support your weight.

Name:	Top of Cliff
Desc:$
   From here you have an unencumbered view of the forest canopy.  A river cuts
a swath through the forest, beginning from a cave in the east and ending as a
huge lake to the west.  A small cabin is to the east, perched precariously on
the edge of the cliff.

Desc:$
   The small log-cabin here must have been hewn from logs that were chopped in
the forest below and dragged up the cliff.  A huge dog, chained the the porch,
is gnawing on some sort of bone. Looking off the edge of the cliff you see a
rushing river.

Desc:$
   The only furnishings inside this cabin are a handpumped spigot and a pile
of straw, presumably the bed of whoever lives here. There are no windows in
the walls and the room is hellishly hot from the blazing logs in the fireplace
that is built into the eastern wall.

to the north is labelled, "Martin Walks Strong, Chief," and a heavy door to
the southeast has a small "Employees Only" sign affixed to it.

   Huge bay windows in the northern wall of this room allow you an impressive
view of the main aviary.  A netted, but otherwise open, ceiling allows
sunlight and other natural elements to enter while preventing the inhabitants
to escape.
   All manner of eagles soar gracefully throughout the aviary.  For a moment
you even make out the majestic shape of a bald and a golden eagle soaring
above the tree spotted landscape.  A smile creeps across your face as you see
one of the smaller eagles swoop down on a field mouse and carry it away to its
doom before your eyes.

   More bay windows allow you an unobstructed view of the smaller chambers
where falcons and hawks are raised.  Trees and boulders are scattered about
the artificial landscape to keep the birds acclimated to the environment to
which they will be released to. Despite the thick barrier between you and the
birds, you jump  when a shrill cry pierces the air.  You look up just in time
to duck from a huge hawk that is diving at you.  The hawk swerves out of the
way as you look around to see how many people observed you cowering behind the
glass from the bird of prey.

Name:	Hatchery
Desc:$
   This place could only be described in one word, cute.  All around the
hospital-clean room eggs are inside fishtank like incubators, while newly
hatched chicks are fed by lab workers under the guise of mask spells that make
the chicks think they are being fed by adult birds.  One tank that is close to
the dividing window holds the eggs that are due to hatch today.  As you look
over the few empty shells, out of the corner of your eye you see an egg
rocking back and forth.  As you inspect the shell with increased curiosity, a
small beak pushes its way through.  After about five minutes of struggling, a
brand new baby falcon emerges and squeeks at you.

lighting burns at your eyes, and when combined with the blank white walls and

the hallway, a steel door is set in the east wall, and a double wide
corrogated steel door to the south lets transports be unloaded.

contain rodents of varying sizes waiting to be released to the birds.  A large
box, actually a compactor, is where dead birds are places for 'reclaimation.'

breeze.  Whenever important documents need to be reduced on the grand scale
this is where the wage slaves are sent.

swim oceans or climb mountains without having to leave the comfort of the well
padded form fitting chair placed in the center of the room.  Filling the
entire wall opposite the door is an immense fishtank.  From poisonous lionfish
and dangerous electric eels, to small sharks, the all sorts of rare and exotic
marine life exist in the tiny glass cage.  If desired, a simple push of a
button can alter the climate from the sweltering heat of the Serengeti to the
sub-artic temperatures of Siberia.  Whatever your choice, this room is
guaranteed to make to occupant forget all the worries of real life.

   A multitude of paths meet at this brightly lit room.  The harsh halogen
flood lights remind you of the kind used at the Seahawks' stadium.  As you
eyes compensate for the light you see an odd sight.  The smoothly polished
rock walls of this chamber are riddles with bullet holes.  A second after you
see the holes you realize what caused them.

Desc:$
   This section of the tunnel is so dark you cannot imagine that it is still
used by anyone.  The loose rock on the wall and floors make walking difficult
and the twisting passages strain your sense of direction to the upmost.  About
the only thing the could be worse would be if mine gas starting to seep in.
It seems that you are safe for the moment at least.

   The light here is just bright enough for you to make out shapes, but not
bright enough to allow you to identify them with any real accuracy.  A row of
tiny lights running down the length of the passage illuminate your path.  From
the southwest a rank odor drifts in and to the north you can see a brighter
room.

Name:	Smooth Chamber
Desc:$
   A huge vault door in the eastern wall confronts you here.  Magical torches
keep the room alight.  You think you can smell a slight scent of booze in the
air, but it is hard to tell in the damp cavern.

Name:	Stinky room
Desc:$
   The stench of death overpowers you in this room and droplets of water fall
from the ceiling onto your face. To the north you see a tiny passageway with a
boulder placed over the entrance in such a way that once a person crawls
through, the rock slides back into place sealing the passage from a return
trip.  Through the tiny crawlway you do see a glimmer of light, but cannot
make out any details of the room beyond the hole.

lightbulb gives the room the same atmosphere found in fun places such as dark
alleys and holes in the ground.

walls flash and pulse with information and thousands of data packets are flung
from one section to another as vital system information is monitored and
computed.  A glowing ball of light is in the center of the room.

   The first thing you notice when you walk in isn't the mirror-like waxjob
that's been done on the hardwood floor. It isn't the ferns that have been
placed in each of the corners of the room. It's not even the holographic
images of sky and clouds that fill the ceiling. No, the first thing you notice
is the horrible, nerve-grinding muzak being piped in from somewhere. This is
definetly a doctor's office.

   You manage to find a grasp on the shaft below and fling yourself upwards.
Unfortunatly, you fling yourself right into the ventilation fan.  On a
positive note, your death is quick and painless as the whirling fan blades
perform a messy, but effective, full frontal lobotomy to you.  Oddly enough,
the last thing to cross your mind, before the blades, is you asking yourself
if your corpse will stink up the building as it rots in the vents.

   The walls of this round chamber are made of granite and at least six meters
tall.  The room itself is round, approximately fifteen meters in diameter, and
the sounds of animals, both forest creatures and city dwelling creatures,
fills the air.  In the center of the room is a white circle.  The circle has
tiny pictures of animals drawn on its lines and at each of the cardinal, as
well as the intermediate, directions there are flaming candles mounted on
golden bases. As you take in the sight a pungent smell that reminds you of
both the pines of the forest, as well as the sewers and alleys of the city.
