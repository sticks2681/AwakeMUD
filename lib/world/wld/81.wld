Name:	Interstate 5
Desc:$
   Interstate 5 continues through a rural environment, southwest of Tacoma.
You see some activity in the distant southwest, with some large block-shaped
buildings and a few communities, as well as frequent helicopter flyovers.  In
this area it is not unheard of to see UCAS panzers driving down the freeway.

   Interstate 5 continues through a rural to suburban area, copses of trees
lining the road in some places, and small communities built together in
others.  Farther ahead, you see Fort Lewis, a community built on a strong
military tradition.  Nearby you see a helipad with a small hangar, just over a
field of shrubs.

   Along the sides of the roads are various copses of coniferous trees, and
patches of housing for well-to-do denizens of the Tacoma/Fort Lewis area.  In
the distance to the west are some forested hilly areas, and to the east you
see beyond some trees through clear patches, the wastelands of Puyallup.
Farther southwest, the population density increases, and to the northeast is
Tacoma.

   The traffic here is quite sporadic, mostly commuters driving the
Seattle/Fort Lewis commute.  Along the sides of the freeway are a few lines of
coniferous trees and some upper to upper-middle class suburban living
communities.  On the highway itself, there is a modicum of gang activity, as
the Eye Fivers claim this stretch of highway as theirs.

   Interstate 5 curves here, going northward to Seattle, and southeast towards
the elven nation of Tir Tairngire.  In the southbound lane, a sign tells the
mileage from here to La Center, Vancouver and Portland.  The road runs through
a hilly, forested wilderness governed by the Sinsearach Council.  The air is
clear and misty, no pollution of any kind in the air.

   These mountainous stretches of Interstate 5 are quite trecherous, often
with icy conditions that cause vehicles to go careening down the canyon wall
on the west side of the freeway, despite the wall that has been built
alongside the western shoulder.  On the east side of the freeway is a very
tall rock wall created by the highway's cutting into the mountain face.

   The highway is icy here, high up in the mountains.  Regularly scheduled
snowplows come through here to keep the road clear of year-round snowdrifts.
A sign saying "^YBE SAFE - USE SNOWCHAINS^n" is readable in both the northbound
and southbound lanes.  The center divider is a narrow meter-tall strip of
concrete with orange reflectors on it.

   This icy highway curves southward and northeast, around the side of a
mountain.  The grade is downhill towards the south, where it appears to dip
down in a small mountain valley.  An accumulation of snow is built up on the
sides of the freeway, where the snowplows that regularly clear the road shovel
the snow.

way down below.  There is ice buildup on the highway during most of the year,
even sometimes in July and August.  Frequent reminders to use snow chains in

Ancients.  The traffic here is normally large trucks carrying cargo from the
Port of Seattle into Tir Tairngire.

more traffic than is seen on this highway, save for the warring gangers east

   The highway, surrounded by vast expanses of evergreen forests, is sharply
in contrast with the gang wars that happen continually along this highway.
Two gangs lay claim to the highway, and neither seem to be giving up their
claims, which results in a near-constant war between the two parties, the
Knights of the Mark and the Sinsearach Ancients.  The burnt out remains of a
truck are on the north shoulder.

   This highway, surrounded by quaint evergreen woods is sharply contrasted by
what looks like a bloodbath that occured here some time ago, apparently a
conflict between the Sinsearach Ancients go-gang and the Knights of the Mark.
A dead body is on the ground, the corpse of a member of the Sinsearach
Ancients gang, already looted for everything of value.  Pieces of his
motorcycle lay in ruins alongside the highway.

that point it runs into highway 229.  Westward, is Interstate 5.  This stretch
of highway, being the point between I-5 and Highway 229, is a disputed zone
between the Sinsearach Ancients and the Knights of the Mark.  It isn't
uncommon to see the two gangs in full scale battles along the highway.  A few
shell casings along the side of the road tell a tale of strife.  To the north
you can see Mount Rainier in the distance, and you are surrounded by evergreen
forests.

Desc:$
   This stretch of Highway 21, though well maintained, sees much chaos and
strife, as it is a stretch of highway disputed by the Ancients and the Knights
of the Mark go-gangs.  It is not uncommon to see several ganger corpses along
the side of the road, or decimated motorcycles belonging to unlucky gangers.

Desc:$
   Highway 21 runs east to west through a dense forested landscape.  A ways to
the east is a small grouping of buildings, a hamlet called J'Valdi.  Directly
north, you can see Mount Rainier.  A dilapidated fence covered in Ancients
graffiti crossed out by the Knights of the Mark gang guards someone's property
on the north side of the highway.

Name:	Highway 21 - Start Ele'gnani Road
Desc:$
   Highway 21 expands from the cobblestone road to the east to a well
maintained two lane highway to the west.  Westward the forest becomes dense,
through a long valley.  A sign says, "La Center, Junction I-5 40 kilometers"
in the westbound lane.  The air is clear and crisp, without the pollutants
found in the air of the Seattle sprawl, which seems vastly distant in this
rural landscape.

Name:	Ele'gnani Road (Highway 21)
Desc:$
   The cobblestone gives way to plain vanilla tarmac westward as Ele'gnani
Street and J'valdi ends, and Highway 21 proper begins.  Eastward you see a
small hamlet with cobblestone roads and beautiful wooden houses with veneer
siding, covered with ivy.  A sign on the east lane's side says, "Entering
J'Valdi, Highway 229 1 kilometer".

   Evergreen Boulevard to the east of here stretches into East Vancouver,
through some commercial sectors.  Southward is the Columbia Bridge, heavily
guarded by Tir Tairngire Peace Force Paladins.  The sound walls on each side
of the freeway are covered by Ancients graffiti, showing their presence even
out here.

   Going down the southbound lane is a sign that says, "^GMill Plain and Highway
229, Next Exit^n".  In the northbound lane you see a sign saying, "^GEvergreen
Boulevard, Downtown Vancouver 1 km^n".  From here, looking southward you see a
very large collection of military in crimson and white gathered around the
gateway to the Columbia Bridge.  Often the truck traffic bringing cargo into
the Tir through there will back up clear to here.
