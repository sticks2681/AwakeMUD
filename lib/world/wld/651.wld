Name:	Cafe
Desc:$
   The walls, floor and ceiling of this rectangular area are covered with
bright, multicolored spatters of paint or gel, making them look like an
exceptionally cheerful Jackson Pollock painting. Framed movie posters from the
20th and early 21st centuries also adorn the walls. Small wrought-iron tables
and matching chairs are scattered around the east side of the room, near a
glass case displaying some of the cafe's culinary offerings. The area along
the west wall has been left bare of furnishings, providing moviegoers with a
narrow north-south passageway into the theater area proper. A melancholy
French ballad plays softly over hidden speakers, and the mingled smells of
strong coffee, red wine and rich baker's chocolate fill the air.

While many of the faded posters are of French classics such as "Jules et Jim,"
"Un Coeur en Hiver" and "Alphaville," others are of movies as disparate as
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," "Singing in the Rain," "The Seven Samurai,"
"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" and "The Return of the King."

Name:	A Corner Table
Desc:$
   This small, wrought-iron table is squeezed into a corner, providing it with
relative isolation from its fellows. Four matching chairs surround it, their
hard metal seats covered with soft, bright cushions. This spot also provides
you with a good view of the street outside, albeit one partially blocked by
the large potted plants that sit in a row along the windowframe. The sounds of
the cafe and street alike are barely audible from here.

   The walls of this small, dim corridor are covered in old movie posters.
Thick double doors to the north presumably lead into the cinema itself; a
synthwood table and electronic cash register sit placidly in front of them.
Two doors set into the east wall are labelled "Unisex Restroom" and "Manager's
Office," respectively; a small spiral staircase sits in the northeast corner.

The small black-and-white flier explains that the cafe/cinema was established
in 2062 to give film aficionados a place in which to watch old two-dimensional

reproduction of a small, late 20th-century cinema, and has been built to
conform to the THX standards used widely at the time. The schedule itself is a
widely varied mixture of films from the 1920s to the 2020s.

   This large, rectangular room is a mess of makeshift shelves, piled-up
synthwood crates and glass display cases. Plastiboard signs hanging from the
ceiling divide the chaos into three loose categories: "Costumes/Makeup," above
a row of racks and an almost ceiling-high mound of assorted clothing;
"Props/Scenery," atop a mess of furniture, fake weapons and rolled-up canvas
backdrops; and "Equipment," above a collection of lights, soundboards and
sundry machinery. The rhythmic beats and swirling synthesizers of neo-disco
music blare from hidden speakers, and a faint, musty odor permeates the air. A
tinted glass window to the west looks out onto First Street.

Name:	The "Seattle Voice" Office
Desc:$
   A battered blue couch and synthwood coffee table by the entrance seem to be
the only concession to guests. There's no reception desk, just six mismatched
desk-and-chair sets arranged in two rows. Each desk sports a cyberterminal and
varying amounts of papers, disks, personal effects, coffee mugs and, in some
cases, empty takeout containers. The walls are covered with framed covers of
past issues of the "Seattle Voice" and various journalism awards.

different types of tea.

   Cool, dry air from a ceiling grate provides ventilation to this small,
windowless room. Most of the available space is taken up by a large synthwood
conference table and several mismatched chairs. The shelves that line the
white plaster walls are laden with books, disks, magazines and all sorts of
odd little trinkets and toys. A small table against the east wall holds a
trid, a stereo system and a projector.

   Or to the floor of the stairwell below, whichever you prefer. You're close
enough to the ceiling and the skylight itself to see the grey cobwebs in the
corners and the irregularities in the dirty window glass. There's not much to
get a grip on or hang onto here, though the plaster walls should support
crampons decently, and hopefully the metal rebar next to the skylight can take
a grappling hook.

   This flat rooftop is covered with asphalt. A razorwire-topped fence runs
along its borders. While it's mostly stood up to the rigors of time, weather
and vandals, it does seem to sport a roughly human-sized hole in its eastern
portion, which may make it possible to clamber down to the roof of the shorter
building there.

time of day or night, a variety of students and sundry patrons can be found
here, drinking soykaf, working, or chatting amongst themselves. A random
assortment of jazz, retro-ambient and lounge music constantly drifts from the
ceiling speakers. Colorful paintings in a variety of styles hang from the
white plaster walls, and overstuffed sofas and chairs cluster around coffee
tables of varying sizes, giving the place a warm, homey feel. The red-tiled
floor is spotlessly clean, as are the glass display case and steel magazine
rack next to the cash register. The smells of buttery croissants and fresh
soykaf fill the air.

armchairs line the walls; a few larger tables with wooden dining chairs

occupies most of the north wall. A mixture of old-fashioned ambient and
Russian balalaika music plays softly from hidden speakers, and the mingled
smells of vodka and leather fill the room.

Name:	A Corner Table
Desc:$
   A small, circular oak table sits in the southwest corner of the room,
flanked by two large, overstuffed leather armchairs. The already toned-down
music and the subdued sounds of dining and conversation are even softer here.
There are no sconces nearby, and the main source of light is a flickering
candle in a crystal bowl at the table's center.

   A huge grey marble fireplace in the north wall dominates this portion of
the room. Various ornaments - colorful nesting dolls, model ships, and an
old-fashioned brass clock have been placed on the mantelpiece. A life-sized
painting of a tall, moustached man in archaic clothing hangs directly above
it; a small label on the ornate picture frame identifies him as "Peter I." Two
oak tables and a few chairs sit to either side of the fireplace, far enough
away to avoid burns, but close enough to warm cold extremities.

the west. The heat from the fireplace is just barely noticeable from here.

   This portion of the lounge area is fairly dim, and the heat from the
fireplace is just barely noticeable. There are no wall sconces, and the small
candles placed in the tables' centers provide the primary source of
illumination. A discreet oak door with a brass doorknob is embedded in the
east wall, next to a life-sized oil painting of a melancholy-looking fellow in
an archaic red military coat. A small plaque on the frame identifies him as
"Alexander I."

   In contrast to the rest of the establishment, the kitchen is bright,
metallic and thoroughly modern. A long stainless steel counter stretches along
the north wall, providing both sinks and working space; an industrial-sized
dishwasher and garbage disposal rest beneath it. A huge freezer, two
refrigerators and a walk-in pantry sit against the west wall, and a large,
stainless-steel butcher block table stands in the center of the room. Counters
along the east wall provide a place to park finished dishes for the waitstaff.
A self-locking metal door to the west is marked "Exit."

   This narrow, matter-of-fact stairway doesn't seem intended for much guest
use. The walls are plain cinderblock; the stairs, metal, with a rubber
non-slip runner down the middle; the lights, bright halogen. A small security
camera with a fisheye lens blinks placidly from a ceiling corner.

   Insanely fast neo-speed-techno-house-pop blares from four corner speakers
as you walk into this small boutique. Multicolored ceiling spotlights swing
back and forth, randomly illuminating parts of the store. The walls, shelves
and counter are all painted matte-black - probably to provide maximum contrast
to the shiny, glittery, glowy, blinky and sometimes well-nigh blinding clothes
and jewelry on sale.

   This small, cluttered shop smells like dust, old-lady perfume and used
clothing. Japanese paper lanterns over the lightbulbs dangling from the
ceiling soften the fluorescent glare somewhat. The synthoak walls are almost
completely covered in various items of vintage clothing from a variety of
ages; even more clothes sit unsorted in wire bins in the middle of the room. A
small synthwood counter by the door holds a cash register and a selection of
leaflets, most of them advertising underground art shows and obscure bands.
