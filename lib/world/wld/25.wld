Name:	Beckett Street
Desc:$
   Beckett Street is divided from Marquez by the Interstate 5, looming
omniously to the north. The noise from the traffic pervades all this distance,
leaving the background volume at a dull roar. This side of Tacoma appears much
more modern than the north side, despite the lingering damage from the Night
of Rage.

Desc:$
   Urban development has been slow in this part of Tacoma, but what has been
done is impressive. The streets are much cleaner than in the north, and the
architecture is up-to-date. A fancy showroom is lit up to the west of here.

Name:	Newman at South Tacoma Way
Desc:$
   South Tacoma Way runs east from here, leading to the east end of Tacoma at
Allen Street.  Along South Tacoma are quaintly designed brick high-rises, or
rather, high-grade plastibrick, with an excellent view of the wilderness to
the south.  Coffee carts and bagel stands are a common sight along the way, as
well as people getting in fist-fights over the unmetered parking spaces along
the street.

Name:	South Tacoma Way
Desc:$
   South Tacoma Way is a quaint commercially zoned street, with uniformly
colored high-grade red plastibrick buildings overlooking the hilly grasslands
to the south.  For the property values, its a good thing those grasslands are
hilly, because not too far south is the coal plains, but they are not visible
to the people in these highrises, save for those at the very highest levels.

Tacoma Way.  To the north, just two and three blocks away, are the goliaths of
architecture, the Knight Center, headquarters for Ares Macrotechnology, and

   The smell of coffee is in the air, as a high-grade soykaf shop sells
mochas, espressos, and cappucinos to the working people in this neighborhood,
for which there are many.  Brick red high-rises dominate this block, uniformly
built high grade offices populated by successful but not large companies, and
subsidiaries of megacorporations who are allowed autonomy on some levels.

Name:	Hallway
Desc:$
   The end of the hallway seems to be pretty plain, with white walls, a white
stucco ceiling, a linoleum floor, and fluorescent lighting.  A buzzing sound
fills the air, seemingly from above.  There isn't much to see here, and the
air smells like fresh paint.

Desc:$
   A pretty plain white room with white walls, and a linoleum floor, separated
from the west part of the building by a steel door.  Guards stand watch over
this room, as well as several security cameras, all placed in even intervals
to give whomever is watching this room many angles of view of whoever may be
trying to break into the server farm just west of here.

Name:	Server Farm
Desc:$
   An aisle is laid out through the center of the server farm, where hundreds
of rack-mounted servers run at all hours, a system of parallel computing of a
very high magnitude.  Ever imagined a beowulf cluster of Fairlights?  Well
here's one for you.  A sticker on each of the servers shows its node-name,
with the caption under it *9 Year Uptime - Renraku NT Free GNU System*.  There
is always a system adminstrator at work in this room, spending most of his
time playing Nethack on the workstation at the work desk.

   Rovers graffiti covers every available surface in the underpass providing
colourful scenery for the regular traffic that streams through. The roar of
the traffic overhead drowns out nearly all sound down here. Rover gang members
seem to be using this as a hangout, many mill around in groups, some around
large burning oil drums.
