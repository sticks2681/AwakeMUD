   You come across a strange little construction tucked away in the jungle.
Made crudely from straw and mud, this hut stands rather shakily out of the way
of the jungle trail.

Name:	A White Sand Beach
Desc:$
   A beautiful beach, fine white sand, white as ebony, greets you. As your
feet sink beneath the silky surface of the beach, you see the expansive lake
at the edge of the sand. It stretches out as far as the eye can see, and
bobbing around in the water, are crystals and jewels of unimaginable beauty.

   You come across a deep fence, made out of bamboo, wood, and all manner of
junk you might find in the jungle. Several towers are lined up along the
fortifications, all of them seem to be keeping a bead on your activities.

   Inside the village, a small blue hut peeps out at you, from the near

Name:	An Underwater Tunnel
Desc:$
   You plunge beneath the waves, the cool water lapping around you, swirling
you downwards. Brilliant crystals and jewels wink out at you through the
colourful waves, hiding in the recesses of the radiant coral below.

   You come across a strange little construction tucked away in the jungle.
Made crudely from straw and mud, this hut stands rather shakily out of the way
of the jungle trail.

carpets stretch out left and right, and ahead of you stands a Reception desk
for  visitors. The walls are neatly decorated, not originally too flashy.
However, a couple of years of having a group of Mages living here has left
some of  the walls rather funnily marked. The soft whirring of the air
conditioning gives the place a sort of hotel feeling to it, all you need now
is a Bellhop.

The tops are all swept clear, polished to a shining coat. The desk is planted

round the corners, to your left and right. The lamps above you shine warmly,
bathing the whole lobby in a soothing dull hue.

   The hallway leads eastward, and you step into the light of an adjoining
corridor, that moves south. You can make out several doors further down the
southern corridor, while the eastern one continues on for several more paces.

   The walls are cleaned pretty often from as much as you can tell, and smell
of detergent. Rather than installing wallpaper, the hallways have been coated
with a protective paint. Several cameras spy down on you from several corners
in each section of the hallway.

Three barstools are bolted down alongside a shiny metal plated deck that runs
parallel to one of the far walls. Two fans spin gently overhead, brushing the
room with a constant air flow.

   Small, shiny lamps, one third metal, one third glass, one third wax. They
glow brightly in the corner, the wax convulsing and contorting in the liquid

The room itself is pretty plain, but those lamps really are cool....

Michaelangelo's private collection.

   Here it is. The main control center for the entire Pyramid's matrix
network. Although its contained in a sort of mess-hall type room, it's
probably one of the most important rooms in the entire complex. Several people
stand above a massive screen in the floor, some linked into the system, some
simply checking all the network functions.

   Divine. You stand in the presence of some of the greatest power in the
world. In here, the fate of countries, people, cultures, businesses, and
economies is decided. On three walls, a giant trid display and massive digital
speakers are pushed back into the walls, and in the center of the room, lying
quietly under the shade of dimmed spotlights, lies a grand table. Oval in
shape, a deep walnut in colour, this truly is a masterpiece. Each place at the
table is marked with a solid gold plaque and a luxurious leather chair behind.
Plantlife is placed aesthetically but not obstructively, and from the looks of
it, it would take a microscope to find a spot of dust anywhere.

   You stand at the edge of a deep chasm. As you peer over the rocky ledge,
your eyes are drawn immediately to the golden sun in the center of what
appears to be an immense waterfall. The water originates from the ledge you're
standing on, and rushes downwards at a great pace towards the radiant sun
below. The glimmer of diamonds, rubies, and sapphires winks out at you through
the waves of rushing data, blurred but at the same time shining clearly.

Name:	A Dense Wall of Undergrowth
Desc:$
   A compacted wall of deep green undergrowth pushes against you, struggling
to keep you out. Trees seem to bend towards you, as do the weeds and leaves
from surrounding foliage, all trying to hold you back.

   A narrow trail has been cut through the undergrowth, leading you onwards

rest here.

Desc:$
   A huge ring constructed out of marble pops out at you from the undergrowth,
as you reach what appears to be a clearing. As you approach it, you can see
strange etchings carved in concentric circles on the surface, and as soon as
you step within the circle, a huge porthole opens up out of the air below you.

   Away from the jungle path, a deep cavern opens up below you. As you peer
down, you fail to grasp just *where* exactly is the floor. Whether you're one
for potholing is another question....but the cavern looks pretty hostile from
here.
