Each microscope has a small petrie dish,terminal, and box of utensils beside
them. This room is obviously used to examine BioHyde products on a molecular
level.

Name:	Hermetic Initiation
Desc:$
   As you place your foot through the wooden door, you fall onto something you
DEFINITELY shouldn't have. Screams of agony ring through the room as twisted,
dark looking mages sacrifice a small cat, as part of a group initiation. Yes,
it is gruesome, and certainly not a nice thing to do, but after all, its one
of the possible ordeals, that mages can use to reduce karma expense.

   The silence you've gradually gotten used to is suddenly pierced by the
howling shriek of something dying next door. You contemplate in the shade of
the corner whether to peer quickly round the door, or to mind your own
business and go back south to the comfort of Dean Mason's Secretary.

   The floor feels smooth under your feet, due to immense wear, and also
because of the large presence of water around you. Somehow a water pipe of
some kind has broken, and noone has yet decided to fix it.

Name:	Commander Beurring's Office
Desc:$
   Commander Beurring is obviously a naturally quiet man, with a ferocious
temper like no other. Luckily his temper is nothing to worry about unless you
really piss him off. Even if he is quiet though, he is one of the three
driving forces behind this camp, and essentialy evil.

Name:	Hall of Power
Desc:$
   As you step through the glass doors, the mood of the hallway immediately
changes. Where it was once dark and rancid, the hallway has become clean, well
kept and fresh. Paintings of historical Nazi figures are framed against the
wall. Ornaments are also placed inside display cases, and you come to the
conclusion that this really is a Hall of Power.

Desc:$
   Skulls and various other human remains lie about the room in disorder. For
some reason they are all polished and cleaned impeccably. Even the desk has
two human skulls as paperweights. The room has an air of mothballs, and the
mood is one of morbidity.

Name:	Grand Master Nitler's Office
Desc:$
   You have arrived in the domain of the supreme leader. Nitler is the man
that came up with the idea of the Camp, and funded it from his private
account. The walls are all dressed in blood red velvet, as is the carpet. A
huge painting of Adolf Hitler lies behind the desk, and is obviously worth a
fortune, for as you examine it, you find it is an actual genuine painting from
the 20th century.

Aztechnology itself, the tower would have to be one of the city's wonders. But
even this is still breathtaking. Two huge double doors rimmed with bronze lead
the way inside, and walls are all constructed of platinum-titanium alloy for
added strength and durability.

Desc:$
   Two large Aztechnology SecureCore Barriers stand here ominously. They are
the highest standard of protection available at the moment, and the only other
time you have ever seen them is in JFK International Airport. Four heavily
armed guards stand watch, and the huge cathedral-like hall extends north,
east, and west.

   You inadvertently step into the middle of one of the mock Ritual circles,
and for some reason you sense a strong magical aura. As you examine the
surroundings, the blue paintings, the strange african items and rune carvings
lead you to believe this might not be a mock circle after all........

replica of a set of teeth from the biggest and most dangerous sharks in the

Desc:$
   You enter the small clean beginning of a hallway that branches of to the
left and right. Hanging from the ceiling is a large digital bulletin board
displaying times of classes, special notices and announcements. A little down
the way is a small secretary desk, preceding the Dean's Office.

   A cool breeze sweeps through the hall from the fans overhead, picking up
small scraps of paper and late homework assignments. The hallway keeps on
going north towards a small section of steel lockers, where students probably
keep their notebooks, manuals and other items they need for the classes.

   The hallway leads north, and the beige wallpaper radiates brightly with the
sun from outside streaming through the steel windows. Along the left side of
hallway all the way down are large classrooms, involving the beginner courses
for ambitious mages. Although the hermetic path is meant to be a solitary
life, one of learning for yourself, the Academy uses these very classes to
help young magicians get a foothold.

Desc:$
   A large arena type classroom stands before you, a small speaking floor in
the center. From there the teacher obviously dictates and displays the
beginning of magic and its capabilities. This class deals with the very start
of magic in one's soul. From the time that a mage feels his first hit of
astral power, to the point of casting spells, this class develops
understanding for all the younger people unsure of the changes overcoming
them.

   A young man is bent over the stove in the far corner, uttering strange
ancient texts, obviously conducting an assignment for this Alchemy Class.
Where the  Shaman version of this class involves exotic materials such as
dragon blood and bat skin, the Hermetic equivalent is much more clean cut and
exact. All the little vials and bottles on the shelves are neatly labelled and
beakers full of condensed materials are placed in a clear glass heater, as the
Mage apprentices attempt to separate more orichalcum from a composite mixture.

offensive and defensive capabilities for, shall we say, "advantageous" uses.
