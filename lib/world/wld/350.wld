Name:	Stairs - To Second Mezzanine
Desc:$
   When the time comes to leave the sprawling glass dome behind and return to
the world below, this is the place to come. Simple silver metal forms the
sides of a black-handled, gray-staired staircase leading back to the lower
levels of the Arcology. Signs bid you watch yourstep carefully, as accidents
are known to happen.

Name:	Escalator from Below
Desc:$
   The escalator carries you up into a hall unlike anything else. High above
you, the ceiling is nothing but a sweeping glass dome, supported by clear
plasticrete beams. The elements work their havoc beyond, while in here, you
have nothing to worry about but the nuyen in your pocket. With the air of
earthly drama, there is also an air of wealth like a thick fog here under the
roof.

Name:	A Place to Rest
Desc:$
   A wide bank of plants stands, surrounded by benches. A tall fountain in the
center accompanies the ambience of electronically reproduced harp music with
the sounds of trickling water. Leafy greens surround the fountain all the way
out to the edge, but careful grooming keeps them off the benches.

Name:	You Are Here
Desc:$
   Under the high glass dome, there stands a Trid map of the Arcology. It
displays it no uncertain letters "You Are Here" with a red star near the top.
While it may seem like a nondescript map, it seems to radiate a feeling of
"Don't Panic" in a friendly sort of way.

Name:	A Row of Benches
Desc:$
   A simple row of benches for the relieving of tired, wealthy feet. No
flowers or leafy plants grace this row, but the benches themselves make up for
it. Crafted of fine imported wood and padded thickly with overstuffed cusions,
these mall benches would make fine house furniture, but nothing is too good,
it seems, for the patrons of the Dome.

Name:	Under the Glass Dome
Desc:$
   Here on the top floor, you stand under a wide glass dome. Above you, you
can see the sky and all its wonders, be they the gale of a storm, the light of
the sun, the twinkling stars, or a cloud of putrid smog. Most of the top level
is wide open space, though there are some banks of potted plants surrounded by
benches breaking it up. The throng of shoppers is somewhat less this high up,
and it seems only the very wealthy remain among them.

Name:	Near an Alcove
Desc:$
   A thin silk-like curtain separates this room - and, indeed, the rest of the
Dome - from the small alcove it does nothing to conceal. No smells come from
behind it, only the occasional low whirr of minature mechanisms, dulled
greatly by the weight of the curtain.

a phone, and a security camera - and of course, an information associate.

Name:	Outside Francois' Fabulous Furs
Desc:$
   The smell of strong perfume wafts from behind the beaded-curtain door of
Francois', the finest furrier in all of Tir. While some consider his trade
tasteless, those rich enough to shop under the Dome are rarely so moral.
Francois' shop is hidden from view by a simple beaded curtain, through which
only glimpses of his luxurious wares can be seen.

Name:	The Skyline Cafe'
Desc:$
   Rows of high stools stand before the edge of the Dome, looking south from
the Arcology. Overpaid coporate types, tourists, and anyone with nothing
better to do with their money lounge about here playing chess, checkers, go,
or a half-dozen other archaic games made modern with interactive Trids and
sipping double-decaf-soy-mocha-lattes. The floaty new-age music is just the
icing on the tofu cake in this place.

Name:	The Skyline Cafe' Cashwrap
Desc:$
   Just inside the plexiglass doors of the Skyline Cafe, you can order as many
overpriced slivers of soy- or tofu-cake and tall, narrow paper cups of
grande-soykaf-avec-creme as your heart desires. Smiling employees speaking in
Linguasoft-perfect English, Sperethiel, or any other language take your order
and your money with equal grace. Behind them, there is only the glass of the
Dome, leading one to wonder where they get the food from.

Name:	Skyline Cafe' - Smoking Section
Desc:$
   It seems this area exists just to prove the Skyline Cafe' management are
not entirely health freaks. Here, cigarettes of every sort are as common as
watery soykaf, and the view is not quite so good through the perpetual cloud
of smoke. The same floaty new-age music drifts in, but somehow it doesn't seem
so abrasive as it does in the other areas of the Skyline. Maybe the smoke
makes the music more tolerable...

Name:	Shaded Corner
Desc:$
   Even here under the Dome, in the richest part of Tir, there is always
business to be done by darkness. Heavy curtains keep out the sunlight, and
little artificial illumination is provided. The smell of smoke - some from
tobacco, some from gunpowder - hangs in the air. The tables are polished to a
shine, making the little light that is here bright enough to see by, while the
rest of the furniture is made in shades of black and dark purple to keep it
from being too bright.

Desc:$
   A variety of sounds and smells emerges with each smiling, satisfied diner
from the Phoenix Landing, Tir's most exilerating dining experience. It's run
by elves, for elves, and no elf can leave the restaurant without good to say
about it. Most find the all-elf staff especially welcoming, though patrons of
other races find them, at best, cool. A sign hangs between the doors.

Desc:$
   A simple row of benches for the relieving of tired, wealthy feet. No
flowers or leafy plants grace this row, but the benches themselves make up for
it. Crafted of fine imported wood and padded thickly with overstuffed cusions,
these mall benches would make fine house furniture, but nothing is too good,
it seems, for the patrons of the Dome.

chefs while speaking in none-too-kind terms about members of the "lesser
races." The Dome itself can be seen ending in the north.

   Here on the top floor, you stand under a wide glass dome. Above you, you
can see the sky and all its wonders, be they the gale of a storm, the light of
the sun, the twinkling stars, or a cloud of putrid smog. Most of the top level
is wide open space, though there are some banks of potted plants surrounded by
benches breaking it up. The throng of shoppers is somewhat less this high up,
and it seems only the very wealthy remain among them.

in the very air itself. It's almost stifling, except to those who put on that
air.

into the ceramic.

money-mad and hyper-paranoid clientele.

Name:	At the Glass
Desc:$
   The Dome finally sweeps downward, plunging almost straight into the floor.
From here, lookers-out can see into the dining room of the Phoenix Landing, an
exlusive restaurant right here in the Dome. One can also examine the complex
pylons that provide the extended dining hall with the support it needs not to
fall from the Dome.

Desc:$
   The Phoenix Landing is one of Tir's finest restaurants. It boasts a
sweeping view from the top of the Dome and a menu custom designed to tickle
the elven palate. It caters only to the finest, of course, and the prices on
the menu reflect their exclusivity. A sign hangs between the doors.

Here, the aura of wealth takes a step back in a nod toward function over form.
Set into the wall is an ATM, the nectar of the wealthy, allowing Dome shoppers

have proven the limits of money.

smells to a minimum. Strong perfume and the rich smell of elven food do fill
the air, making the image of perfect opulence that much thicker. Stout wooden
tables fill - but do not cramp - the floor, leaving just enough space for an
elf or a thin human to make their way through.

   Elven perfume and elven music fill the air, and mercifully little else. The
smells of rich elven food can be detected subtly, just under the layers of
other smells. The seperate dome of the Pheonix Landing soars high above, and
lights hang in particularly thick clusters from it to take up that space. Even
the tables are real wood, as are the chairs, and it begs the question as to
whether the chair seats are real leather.

   The smell of smoke hangs much more lightly in the air than the non-smoking
section would claim. It turns out there is an air filtration system at work
here, though what is between sections is often missed. For the smoke, this
section is no less opulent than its clean-air cousin, with graprefruit
clusters of lights hanging from the ceiling all around and every bit of
furniture crafted of real, solid wood.

Name:	Entryway
Desc:$
   The entryway seems to end here, with the smoking section. The glass wall is
the bottom of the Pheonix Landing's seperate dome, which is propped by strong
pylons against the side of the Arcology dome. The lush carpeting ends at the
glass, though a moveable panel leads out onto the wooden deck of the galleria,
which has an even more epic view of Tir's expanses.

Desc:$
   The Pheonix Landing may deny service based on race, but not for smoking.
This side is every bit as gaudy as the other, with real wood and thick
carpeting everywhere. The smell of smoke is surprisingly light compared to the
aroma of rich food. Clusters of grapefruit lights hang all around, and the
chatter of elves - in English, Sperethiel, and half a dozen other languages -
makes the room a pleasant buzz.

   Hardly the least used section for being farther away, there are a few
patrons here like everywhere else. They are, of course, elves. Just behind
them, the galleria stands exposed to the elements - the price paid for its
enchanting view of Tir. The glass here is made with a shifting tint, so the
light from the setting sun is never overwhelming.

An elevated bandstand rises slightly above the floor, and a semicircle of
small tables stands before it. Like in the non-smoking section, the music is
live and very pleasant - a soothing sound to go with a soothing atmosphere.

restaurant proper. Tables are spaced out along the rail, and all food out here
is fresh off the grill, for those elves who like a more home-cooked flavor.

   The grill is built into the corner of the galleria rail. It is a massive
stainless-steel affair, large enough to cook for a small army, which is
exactly what the jolly, rotund elven cook is usually doing. The view from here
is not so good as in other parts of the galleria, and the spacing between the
wooden planks of the floor is wider - wide enough to see between - and most
people find it unsettling, which is why there are no tables in the corner.

   Sprawled out next to the grill are a bunch of elves who look fresh off the

in beer than money.

Desc:$
   With the music just to the west, and the grill just beyond that, its no
wonder that a section of the galleria has degenerated into a constant party
area. Elves who have shed the stuffy clothing of the restaurant proper (and,
in some cases, most every other type of clothing) dance around to the loud
music of the elven band while drinking strong elven beer and eating strong
elven grill. It seems not every trend of the restaurant proper was left
inside...

Name:	Outside CryptoSoft Inc.
Desc:$
   CryptoSoft Incorporated is an up-and-coming software development firm.
Currently, it consists of nine overclocked deckers, a secretary, and two
salesmen. Their prices are a bit steep, but their stuff is pretty good, and
they'll deal in just about anything technological. Their office is clean, if
spartan, and they use Trids to show a catalog of their work.

   A wide, see-through plasticrete window looks into the Blazing Anvil, a
forge where you can watch your new sword made before your eyes. Laid out in a
wide case behind the window are various feats of weaponcraft - katana,
wakizashi, shuriken, axe, mace, longsword, broadsword, bastard sword, and so
on. The selection is vast, and the prices... the prices just ARE.

Think of it as the Stuffer Shack of electronics shops. It's very simple and
direct, with one of everything they sell laid in a case or hung on a wall
somewhere in the shop. It's all there, if you know where to look, and if you
don't, a uniformed sales associate will be glad to show you.

feel the beedy, sun-deprived eyes of a dozen techno-freaks boring into you

see the dark-addicted elves who you know can see you perfectly in spite of -
or perhaps because of - the interminable gloom.

Name:	The Tech Level
Desc:$
   The gloom deepens between shops. In the void where nothing draws the eye,
there is only the pulsing, green-lit semi-darkness of the Tech Level. Shops
cast almost blasphemously bright light about the outer edge of the level, and
the half-muted music that manages to escape them hums unintelligably through
the gloom.

Desc:$
   Radio Shack keeps some of their wares laid out for display. Mostly this
consists of simple personal computers, phones, and other low-end gadgetry, the
stuff wannabe techno-junkies are addicted to, and the stuff Radio Shack
specializes in. One or two decent cyberdecks grace the collection, accented
with price tags that make a ridiculous markup seem like a bargain.

Name:	A Screen
Desc:$
   A screen bends light about itself to create the image of depth. It
resembles an old-fasioned holographic projection, but the figures are much
more lifelike. Still, it's not Trid, but the advertisements have a certain
nostalgic quality to them. Most of the ads are for things only techno-freaks
would want, like flashing rope lights and panels that let you see through your
computer's sides.

   Darkness seems to seep from the walls even more than does light. The only
light that does exist pulses out from the green circuitry pattern built into
the ceiling. The darkness seems to radiate from the light-shunning deckers,
riggers, and assorted techno-freaks who populate the floor. The air does not
seem heavy, though, as even deckers don't like the smell of themselves, and
air filters are always running, adding a mechanical hum to the drone of
distant shop music.

Desc:$
   The Tech Level, the Telestrian Arcology's cybercenter, looms - or rather,
glooms - around you. Dim lighting and tight spaces create a haven for deckers,
riggers, and anyone else with an aversion to natural lighting. The ceiling is
worked in a black-and-green circuitry motif, the green circuit pathways
shining with a dim green light. It is the only illumination. The walls,
anywhere there is not a shop or show-window, are done in the same circuitry
pattern, but without the lighting.

   Soaped-opaque windows and boarded-shut doors mark an empty store space.
There is nothing inside, nothing outside. Only the dirt-mark outline on the

Continental CyberPhones. It's not there any more, and hasn't been for some
time, if the age-faded "Space for Rent" sign is any hint.

Name:	An Opaqued Window
Desc:$
   A wide plasticrete window, once see-through, is now soaped opaque. It is
difficult, but not impossible, to look past the swirls. Beyond lays only
darkness, and a few broken-down, dust-covered shelves. Though the dust is
thick on every surface, there is none in the air - nothing has moved within
the unoccupied shop space in some time.

Name:	Outside the Spider's Parlor
Desc:$
   The Spider's Parlor is a hole-in-the-wall anticulture shop. The rudest
clothes, the crudest styles, and the loudest music can all be had just beyond
these doors. The salespeople are all teens and most wear the styles they sell,
including a multitude of rings, earrings, and piercings in places they can't
legally show you in public. Samples of the music blare from within, so strong
you can feel it under your feet.

Name:	A Mismatched Corner
Desc:$
   The corner between Doctors without Boarders and The Spider's Parlor seems
very mismatched. On the north wall, black nylon webbing hangs on both sides of
a thick, see-through plasticrete window, shaking in rythm to the pounding
music that window just about contains. On the east wall, a simpler window
looks into a very proper waiting area, with people sitting around reading
magazines and listening to sleepy elevator music. The conflict only enhances
the atmosphere of strangeness that dwells on the Tech Level.

Wanted image, apparently people the Stars have it in for.

their lives protecting the Arcology.

assault rifles, and various arcane gear - robes, foci, and other such - that

kick-your-ass guardsmen in the Arcology make their lair. Alarm buzzers stand
dormant above the doors. Screens show particularly high-risk areas, places the
inhabitants of this chamber most often have cause to go. The rest of the room
is as bland as any other security office: thinly padded chairs and
metal-framed couches line the walls, a Trid flickers in the corner showing
"Tir's Best Police Shootouts 12," and so on.

Name:	The Blazing Anvil Forge and Machining Room
Desc:$
   Slim, nimble elven blacksmiths work studiously, hammering out fine,
lightweight blades. Made in the old style, they use huge furnaces of coals and
barrels of water and oil for cooling. When the hand-forging process is
completed, they turn their creations over to the machining experts, more elves
with more high-tech equipment. Enormous machines are then employed, coating
the blades in synthetic diamond and laser-sharpening them to an edge no
thicker than a single molecule. The sum of their efforts is a traditional, yet
modern, weapon that will never dull and can cut through nearly anything.

Name:	Radio Shack - Adventurers' Supply
Desc:$
   On the shelves, under the armor, and on the wall hang the various portable
electronics that any true adventurer will need. Flashlights, thermo glasses,
even electronic repair tools cover every surface. Like Radio Shack in general,
this is your one stop shop for the gadgetry that makes life simpler.

Name:	Doctors without Borders Fundraising
Desc:$
   To help raise money for their charitable doings, Doctors Without Borders
has set up a small office here. Through an arrangement with DocWagon Inc, they
sell DocWagon modulators for slightly more than cost, using the money to fund
missions. The room is plain; none of their funding goes into furnishings. Like
a regular DocWagon outlet, they provide all three types of DocWagon contracts.

Name:	The Doctor's Office
Desc:$
   The room is simple, made up of an examination table, a wall of simple
diagnostic tools, and a few drawers of over-the-counter medications. A single
doctor is on hand at all times, providing medical attention to those who need
it. Unlike their mission trips, this service is not free, but is provided at
cost.

Name:	Semitronic Computer Supply
Desc:$
   Semitronic is a small office, populated by only a few employees and fewer
clients. They offer the best in decking and personal computing supplies - or
so they claim. Along one wall are a row of crash couches; they provide free
Matrix access to go along with their decking equipment. The rest of the office
is plain and the music in the background is so subtle it is hard to tell
exactly what it is.

Name:	Crypt of the Forsaken Ones
Desc:$
   It looks like the inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Ankhs, images of Anubis,
Osiris, Horus, and Isis abound. Everything is worked in yellow clay-brick and
wrought gold. The air smells musty, like years and years of undisturbed decay
suddenly broken open. Light and air have no place to enter, and nothing has
any way to leave.
