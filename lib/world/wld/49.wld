Name:	An abandoned warehouse in the Elven District.
Desc:$
   A musky, dirty old warehouse from the 20's, with litter, smashed beer
bottles, cigarette butts, empty beer bottles, smashed cardboard boxes, and
burned-out BTL chips strewn about.
   You see elven street kids, who you figure are castaways, runaways, and
other examples of the harsh side of life in this awakened world.

Desc:$
   As you walk up to the northern end of the warehouse, you see a couple of
mattresses and couches, tattered and torn, and a few half-empty beer bottles.
Right near the northwestern corner of the warehouse is a dirty, trash filled
hovel, festooned with fetishes.

unnerving background cacophony.  Despite the fact that this is an elven

Tarislar, an area with a history of misery.

playing, and see a neon sign with an ornate blue dracoform motif, and the
words "Blue Wyvern" in lights.  You hear the sounds of motorcycle engines
taking off and rolling up.

motorcycle gang.  It is built with brick, and despite its location, has no
graffiti on it.  A line of motorcycles are parked in front, Harley Scorpions,
Honda Vikings, and Yamaha Rapiers, all with Ancients colors tagged and painted
on them.  The entrance is a large oaken door, ornately designed with celtic
knot-like patterns.

the air.  The sound all around you is that of screech metal and pool balls
smacking against each other as several gangers intently play a few rounds, and
make or lose much nuyen over the results of their games. The lighting around
you is dim, and the walls are painted black, with green and blue patterns
painted on the wall that glow softly in the blacklights.

Name:	Kennedy Avenue
Desc:$
   You are going down Kennedy Avenue, which cuts through the elven slum of
Tarislar north to south.  You see abandoned buildings, rubble, tenements full
of destitute and miserable people.  Graffiti covers the walls that still stand
and many other signs of misery surround you in the form of burned out BTL
chips, syringes, and broken and empty bottles of alcoholic beverages.

Coleman Street.  East Coleman Street is famous for the elven street gang The

Name:	Sims Drive
Desc:$
   Sims Drive goes north to south through the southern end of Tarislar, the
elven neighborhood in the Puyallup Barrens.  Abandoned buildings surround you.
Ahead of you a few blocks is a large warhouse that appears to be well
maintained.  Around you are torn down walls and other signs of urban blight.
You look into the gutter and see some poor elf sleeping by a broken simsense
unit and about ten burned out BTL's.

   Things around you get more desolate, as you get closer to a large fortified
warehouse to the south.  As you get a closer look, you can see it may not be
too wise to stumble upon their grounds.  To your west and east are piles of
rubble and vacant lots, and to your north is Tarislar.  Highway 229, a
desolate long stretch of lonely mountain road begins here, and extends to the
southwest. Being a side road that goes into Tir Tairngire, it is a favorite
route among smugglers.

   All around you, you see little signs of life, but right ahead of you you
see a well protected warehouse.  It has twenty foot high fences with monowire
surrounding it to prevent intrusion, and an extremely well guarded gate to the
front.  From here you can see they are wearing full security armor, but it is
all black with no corporate markings.  A sign over the entrance to the
warehouse says "Ly'trelli Imports."

Desc:$
   You continue through the Puyallup Barrens, until you reach what appears to
be a more heavily populated area.  You see elves living in destitution and
poverty, the only escape from their harsh daily lives being a BTL, or some
drug made in a lab somewhere.  These are castaways from the  Sinsearach
Council, a people who after the Night of Rage were not accepted into the
Salish Sidhe Nation, and therefore stuck to living a harsh life at the edge of
the Barrens.  It is named Tarislar, the Sperethiel word for "Rememberance," to
remember the Night of Rage and their subsequent rejection.
