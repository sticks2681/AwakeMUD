Name:	a large vestibule in front of the Space Needle
Desc:$
   An immense glass entry way into the base of the tower. It stretches up with
a high glass ceiling to allow light to filter in from the cloudy skies
outside. the floor looks like white marble, and is well polished by years and
years of constant traffic. Small tourist shops line either side of the indoor
plaza and a large row of glass elevators stand against the back wall, directly
under the tower. Large the large arching struts of the tower's base can be
seen overhead through the glass roof

Name:	Infront of the elevators.
Desc:$
   you're standing before the elevators, there are several large glass lifts
set in the wall some have already begin their trip up, whiring softly as they
go. on the wall seems to be a large banner, celebrating the tower's one
hundreth birthday as a recognized landmark of seatle. and between two of the
doors is a small engraved plaque, detailing the construction at the worlds'
fair, a century ago.

   a nice quiet corner of the resturant... so to speak, since the level you're
on is circular.  the atmosphere here is quiet, and private, and the settings
for the table are exquiste, the soft rug under your feet is the sort that
always feels good to walk on. and the view outside, is unusually spectacular,
for being one of a dirty gray cityscape. it has a strange sort of beauty to
it.

safe, and there is an elegantly sculpted white noise generator and sound
dampener set up in the center of the table, for privacy's sake.

Name:	a quiet area
Desc:$
   the area here is quiet and about as secluded as you can get, as most of the
other tables around are empty, the waiters hover unobtrusivly in the
background, and there is a  small and very elegently sculpted white-noise
generator set on the table. made to look like an exquisite centerpiece. this
would obviously be an ideal meetingplace for some high-class johnsons.

Name:	another angle of the archology.
Desc:$
   a quiet 'corner' of the resturant where no one is likely to overhear
conversations.  the table has a great view of the massive archology directly
to the southeast of here.. a huge black and gray monolithic pyrimid. from this
angle its brillance is almost blinding, as a single ray of sun makes it
through the cloud cover to reflect off its surface.

   you're at a private table near the window of the slowly rotating platform
which makes up the eye. Right now your view is to the west, overlooking the
