Name:	The Crossroads
Desc:$
   A rather simple room greets visitors of Rokhalla, the synthwood motif of
something far older and more primitive than its actual construction continuing
inside. Two large signs are visible in the direction of old cliche road
markers. The sign pointing to the west simply says "Fun" while the sign
pointing east denotes "FOOD" and seems to be the bigger focus of the two. Even
here, smoke curls from the eastern path carrying with it the smell of various
tobaccos and, perhaps more importantly depending on the patron, rather
inviting foods while the sound of clattering pins and various electronic
noises echo from the west.

Name:	The Game Room
Desc:$
   The far-reaching remodel has taken the new gaming area in its clutches and
refuses to let go. Perhaps a hint at the eccentricity of the person who designed
it, everything seems to be furnished in a manner that would have fitted vikings.
Not only in the normal means, yes there are wooden chairs and large tankards of
mead that buxom women in period garb offer, but even the bowling alley section
of the area has been remodeled.
   The computer components have all been given the same synthwood paneling, many
of them engraved with elder futhark runes that only one who truly had no life, a
great deal of interest in vikings, or a lot of time on the matrix, would be able
to discern their true meaning. This same change has also been added to the variety
of VRcade machines that have been added in, an entire alcove now far away from the
general thrum of activity when people wish to play so that the gamers can have their
peace and not risk being pulled away before they pull off the perfect combo or get
the high score.
   Toward the southeastern and southwestern corners of the gaming room are two hallways,
each one terminating in a large door: The men's room possesses a silhouette image of a
viking, horned helmet and all, while the women's room's sign is that of a rather ample
maiden in a flowing dress.

Desc:$
      Wow...For someplace that seems to have a viking fetish, the women's room
is actually rather un-viking-like. The walls retain the synthwood paneling but
there is a much greater care for comfort and aesthetics in this room. The
mandatory feminine hygiene dispenser is in place by the door, and the
countertop for the sinks is large and sturdily built. The stalls are full of
fancy toilets with headed, padded seats and the most luscious toilet paper one
could find that didn't actually have the wings of some genetically modified
angel used to wipe you clean of their own will when your business is finished.
   A very subtle scent wafts through the air from the air ducts in the
ceiling, keeping things ventilated and making sure everyone believes that your
emissions actually smell like cinnamon rolls when you open the door to come
out.

      What establishment can truly call itself fancy if they don't have a
fancy restroom? Rokhalla takes this one step further. Men should eat like men,
they should live like men, and they should take their tinkles like men! The
room looks to be a bit darker in appearance than the rest of the building, the
urinal created seemingly from the upturned skull of some ork or troll, its
various holes sealed shut so that there will be no leaks.
   The stalls, likewise (One for regular customers and one for those who are
larger) possess two rolls of toilet paper each. One, for the girliest of the
patrons to this fine eatery, is actually a rather nice triple ply with aloe
added. The other is for the ^Rmen^n possessing what looks to be a large roll of
small grit sandpaper. Straight up sandpaper for the manliest of bungholes.
   The toilets are made for the most discerning of derrieres, heated,
cushioned seats helping even the shiest colon to enjoy themselves from
beginning of the meal to its end.

Name:	The Great Hall
Desc:$
   With the omnipresent haze of smoke from the less-important denizens of the
hall and their discarded cigarettes, it is almost hard to tell exactly what is
in front of someone until their eyes properly adjust. The tinted windows allow
only a very skewed view of what is going outside, especially at night, with the
only source of light being the large sconces set along the wall, each one possessing
faux torches that assist in keeping things from being a blind, drunken gropefest.
   The bar at the far western side of the room has been moved quite a bit away from
the various selections of booze so that those behind it may go through a small door
directly into the kitchen area without having to weave through the three massive
rectangular tables that dominate the main area of the room. No table seems to take
precedence over the other in decoration, their massive clawed feet making them all
but immobile unless an extremely strong trog was to come barreling into them, though
at the head of the center table, facing the opening to the entryway of the building
is a gigantic ^ychair^n that seems to take up its entire shorter end.
   To the north and south, alcoves have been set aside for more private conversations
and to the southeast a doorway leads off to a stairwell that leads down into darkness.

A small picture detailing what appears to be a viking longship, stacked to the
brim with various weapons and armour, forming a small horde of a collection
being set ablaze and consumed by fire. The smoke rises into the sky, ascending
its passenger to the skies above, to Asgard and the halls of Valhalla, where
they may take their rightful seat at Odin's table.
 A small inscription lies below: "Friday, 07/09/64 - Never Forget."
 An
offering has been placed in front of the memorial portrait, which consists of
a large bowl full of hotwings, doused in butter and hotsauce. Followers of the
Jiggle Totem are advised to eat a hotwing and offer a prayer, then toss the
gnawed clean chicken bone over their shoulder to ward off evil fatty spirits.

While the picture frame remains completely untouched, the picture seems to
have suffered an abhorous amount of damage thanks to a matte-black combat
knife jammed firmly into its center. The glass has shattered into millions of
spider cracks, turning its surface opaque, while the knife itself seems to
have been jammed in so hard that it has become sinched into the foundation
sub-strait in the wall behind it.
 An AK-47 hanging above the picture, or what's left of one, has been mangled

Name:	The parking lot of Rokhalla
Desc:$
   Off of North Sixth, the road leads into a massive parking lot, many of the
vehicles left in it having rusted into immovable husks of their former glory.
The dividers for parking spaces are heavily faded, and those with a keen eye
will notice various stains that are scatted around the asphalt that are almost
proudly displayed. The building itself has an equally barbaric facade, appearing
like some kind of strange combination of a modest modern day building and, along
its lowest floor, a viking mead hall.
   Synthwood planks are set over the plasticrete to give a more "natural" feel
to the building, and secured into the facade with thick bolts are various round
shields of different designs, all rimmed in metal and sporting a rather large
metal boss in the center. Numerous colors and patterns are displayed with no
apparent rhyme or reason.
   All of the windows are thick, covered in what appears to be a similar tinting
system to vehicles, making it all but impossible to see anything within, the panes
actually thick bullet resistant plastics, and the doorway is thickset, looking more
akin to a vault door than something meant for a regular establishment. Great care
has obviously been taken in order to make this place as "period" as possible while
remaining incredibly durable to whatever street thugs might come by and want to
cause havoc.

Name:	The Clobberdome
Desc:$
   Where once, through the various iterations of this hallowed building there had
been a ring for warriors to test their mettle against one another, now there is the
Clobberdome. A triumph of combat technology executed on a budget, the majority of
the area is taken up with the dome itself, the heavily reinforced metal framework
supporting chainlink  to make sure that there is almost no way for a combatant to
leave once they have entered through the door which has a convenient metal bar to
secure it. From various parts of the dome, scavenged weapons have been secured to
the structure: Pipes, chains, baseball bats, and other simple objects that contenders
can take should they need them for that extra "oomph" in those moments that call for it.
   The rest of the area is taken up by the seating area. Rows of cushioned chairs are
bolted to the floor so that a great deal of effort would be needed to abscond with them.
The comfort of the spectators apparently is the number one priority of the people who
have designed these so that nothing will detract from the bloodsports taking place
inside the Dome itself.

   To enter this room is to be assaulted by a plethora of stimuli. Scents
range from the sweetness of what one would hope to be fresh fruits, to the
smokey goodness of slowly barbecued meats, all so potent that simply sticking
one's head in would allow them to nearly taste the delicious foods ahead of
time. Various pots and pans are scattered about with different ingredients
ready to become something delectable to one who is ready to pay for such a

Name:	A simple elevator niche
Desc:$
   Set a good ways north of the end of the kitchen, this area of Rokhalla
seems to focus on the simple terminal that rests on one side of the hallway
and the heavy doors of the elevator. A large plaque is visible read "Maximum
safe load: 1000 kilos. Regardless of weight limit, please be careful riding
with the owner." The area looks rather clean, the steam and smoke from the
kitchen not quite reaching here so the residents wouldn't have to worry about
smelling too much like smoked meats and whatever the special of the day was
when going to their rooms.

Name:	Inside an Elevator
Desc:$
   Well, this certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill lift to gently take you
where you want to go with only the faint promise of being dropped to your
death and the cold certainty of knowing that even if you jumped at the exact
right time you would still die. No, this was something much different indeed.
The entire elevator seems to be made of heavily reinforced ceramics and metals
in order to make it the sturdiest thing this side of the Fed-Boeing building.
To the right of the large doors is a simple panel with five buttons on it,
labeled in a way that even a velociraptor could understand. Oddly, there
doesn't seem to be any surveillance equipment set up here, no protruding
cameras watching your every move, no black domes hiding the all seeing eyes,
just cold grey metal.

   Another all white hallway this one at a noticeable slant, seems to go even
deeper underground than the rest of the HQ. The reinforced white walls are
bare but very well lit. Security Cameras are located every few feet to let the
people at the end of the hall know when people are coming.

Desc:$
   This is actually more of a sub-floor than a crawlspace, since it's above
ground, but it's got the same feel as a crawlspace would. It's a short room,
maybe four feet high. It's long enough that a few people could fit in here
alright, but some of the bigger metas might just be SOL.
   In the floor, there's a folded up ladder that might have once been a fire
escape now attached to what looks to be an emergency exit or something.

Desc:$
   In keeping with the viking hall decor, the elevator opens onto a simple
east-west hall with heavy synthwood walls. Various bits and pieces of
different weapons and shields, most of them broken or damaged beyond
reliability, are mounted between the heavy recessed sconces that hold the
"torches" which provide the light for this level. Two heavy doors are
immediately visible though there are no real distinguishing marks aside from
the ancient-looking brass knobs and keyholes.

The various bits and pieces that have been put out here all seem to hold some

into an "X" shape here with the words "Vehemence's limbs." What looks to be
the hilt of a katana is mounted a ways down the wall, the blade appearing to
have been bitten off. "Some stuck up Jappy's rice cutter." A mangled piece of
metal that looks as if it were at one point a cybertorso or something similar
is marked with "Kragg's torso, or what's left of it. Hubris kills." The
trophies continue on down each side of the hall.

   The end of the hallway terminates into nearly half a dozen different rooms,
all possessing the same heavy wooden doors that had been visible when first
exiting the elevator. The viking decor conjures up thoughts of the nordic
warriors' two favorite passtimes: Raping and pillaging. With that fun fact in
mind you suddenly realize that this place seems kind of foreboding, better
hope that you don't drop anything important.

   Polished hard synth-wood floors, strong enough to protect against "hooves",
cover the main room of this apartment in a lush hue of deep golden brown. A
large, comfortable looking couch, covered in soft black linen upholstery, sits
in front of a large trideo display that seems to be attached to the eastern
wall. A matching love seat and recliner take up the flanks of the couch,
surrounding a polished wood coffee table strewn with "Arcane Today" and "The
Mage's Journal" magazines. A small, but efficient kitchen dominates the
western wall, with all the modern conveniences one might ask for, including a
toaster. A Library takes up any room left on the walls, shelf after shelf of
old and new manuals from spellcraft to hexes and their uses. A small circular
sitting rug of lush faux-fur sits in front of one of the shelving units, a few
pillows for comfort upon it, with a few books scattered around. A small
display case stands right beside the door to the apartment, recently dusted.

   Most of the eastern wall of this wood-floored bedroom is dominated by a
massive king sized canopy bed with red and purple silk scarves creating a soft
shaded cover draping around it. A crystal clear window opening up on the
Seattle cityscape takes up a large portion of the northern wall, with a set of
heavy red and purple curtains that could be drawn to block out the light. An
impressive chifforobe sits next to a small desk that has some spell design
papers scattered across the top and a nice reclining desk chair is tucked into
it's little nook beneath the desk. In front of the bed sits a squat, heavy
chest with a few archaic symbols carved into the lid. Several abstract art
pictures of dancers in various poses are attached to the walls in different
spots and a doorway, leading into a modern bathroom with a large tub, is built
into the western wall.

Crafted from solid oak, and stained a dark amber hue, this particular seat has
been crafted to withstand a good deal of weight. An extremely wide base is
flanked on either side by two massive arm rests, which are carved to resemble
the claws of a beast, and are tastefully covered in piasma fur along their
tops.

Name:	The Well
Desc:$
   Despite the close proximity to the brutal combat of the Clobberdome, the Well
is actually rather well insulated against the various crunches of cartilage and
bone snapping from the vicious fights that take place within it, something that
is supplemented by the SOTA sound system that thrums out the proper beats that
a body modification expert needs in order to work the canvas of flesh. Various
sketches adorn the walls like one would expect in any tattoo and piercing parlor,
showing the basics of what the obviously skilled owner is capable of as far as art
goes. The materials, despite what the location might suggest, are in great condition
and the various private chambers for the work to be done are kept pristine.
   The splatters of ink from the well outside can be seen along the wall, appearing
to bleed through the stone into the room itself while the spaces of the walls not
covered by pages of sketches reveal a rather elegant swirling band of black lines
twisting into knotwork patterns and unravelling without true rhyme or reason. Not
exactly something everyone would see, but a detail that has been carefully taken
care of to let those who enter know the proprietor is a true artist.

Name:	A Spacious Living Room
Desc:$
Whoever designed this room clearly has eclectic tastes in style and decoration. The walls are a warm and inviting ivory and the hardwood floors are a rich mahogany. A black leather couch and love seat set about an obviously expensive entertainment system dominate the center of the room, set on a luxuriously soft crimson area rug. The western wall primarily consists of windows that look out onto a large patio, and a cozy kitchen with gleaming chrome appliances and granite countertops is nestled in the northwest corner. A well-appointed drawing desk has been set up on the southern wall against the window while a surprisingly large small animal habitat dominates the southeast corner. Built of wire, wood and ceramic, it is a veritable maze of ladders, shelves, hammocks and hideaways, and filled to the brim with toys. The often open door indicates that either its inhabitant is missing or given free reign of the apartment. The walls are covered with weapons - most of them bladed and decorative, but some quite functional - and framed drawings and paintings. The largest of these pieces of art resides on the southern wall.

	Desc:$
Housed in a museum quality display case, this painting is presented completely
unframed. Done entirely in grey scale, a full moon takes up much of the right
quarter of the canvas, too large to even be fit entirely there. Despite a
cloudless sky, rain falls from it, forming puddles on what is probably a city
street, although the buildings that line it are non-distinct. Beneath a
single, out of place street lamp lit with a guttering candle a woman walks
away into the distance, tall and slender with her long hair falling to her
waist. The picture itself is unimaginably beautiful for all its simplicity,
each brush stroke purposeful and perfect. Interestingly, it is difficult to
tell what medium was used to paint it, from one angle it appears as though it
was done with oil paints, from another, watercolor, and from yet one more,
acrylic. Sometimes it even has the air of a digital print.

Name:	An Expansive Dance Studio
Desc:$
With massive windows spanning the entire eastern wall, this large room is bathed in sunlight during the day, and can be lit from above at night. Although there are light, white silk curtains for the windows, they are invariably drawn back, giving one a view of Seattle. A custom ballet barre runs along the windows, its handrail is made of a warm maple that matches the high quality sprung flooring, and the iron supports are wrought into the form of vines. The southern wall is entirely mirrored, clearly reflecting the rest of the room. The ceiling is high, over three and a half meters, and is painted a simple white, as are the remaining walls. Speakers dot the walls and the controls for this state of the art sound system are located just beside the door. On the other side of the entrance a wide variety of dance shoes occupy a simple shelving unit, and a closet opens off the northwest corner. The ceiling is crisscrossed by dark, metal supports and there are two areas close to the center of the room that look like they might be meant to anchor something.

Desc:$
The single most noticeable feature is the massive bed that takes up most of this room. Larger than king sized, this canopy bed has a wrought iron frame. With curtains and canopy of heavy, dark red, silver and black brocade that are held back with heavy, burnished silver cord. The bed itself is piled with pillows and cushions, the sumptuous sheets and blankets a dark red, accented with black and silver. The floor is carpeted in a rich, incredibly soft deep red, and the walls are paneled with mahogany. While much of the western wall consists of windows looking out onto a patio, their curtains a matching brocade, and a set of French double doors open out from the center of the wall. Wrought iron brackets support frosted glass light sconces that offer this room illumination. Additional furniture, including a vanity and delicate looking chair, is done in mahogany, wrought iron, and occasionally rich brocade. The northeastern corner hosts an equally luxurious bathroom, the fixtures a gleaming white against the dark, polished marble floor and counters. It hosts a bathtub large enough for two and a glass walled shower equally as large, frosted windows along the exterior walls allowing sunlight into the small room.

Name:	A Large Open-Air Patio
Desc:$
   Easily half of this patio is sheltered and shaded by an arbor of green ivy.
It grows mostly along a maple lattice that is built out from the building,
supported by wooden posts, but vines of it have crept down about the windows.
Bounded by a decorative wrought iron balustrade, the patio is tiled with
smooth, pale grey stone. Chairs, lounges and tables of wrought iron and glass
are scattered about the patio, and a well stocked bar resides by the wall,
against the door. A decently sized space outside of the shelter of the arbor
has been left clear of furniture, however. On the far end of the patio from
its entrance, located mostly beneath the green cover, is a slightly raised
dais into which a sunken hot tub has been placed. Fluffy white towels as well
as white cushions for the furniture are located beneath a specially designed
shelter to keep them protected from Seattles frequent rains.

Desc:$
   Half closet and half storage, this room looks like it has two distinct
personalities. With plain ivory walls and carpet, its nothing to write home
about, certainly. The third of the room closest to the door hosts a shockingly
large amount of clothing, some hung on closet bars built into niches in the
wall, and others pushed into mismatched wardrobes and dressers. Some articles
and shoes are strewn about the floor here, or piled into a tumbled mess. Its a
slightly chaotic mess, especially when compared to the rest of the room.
Populated by rows of neat shelving units, as well as the occasional rack or
other item built into the wall, every item within it, and there are many,
seems to have a proper place. At least in this part of the room, everything is
neatly organized, often packed into boxes or piled neatly on a shelf.

Two desks are set up here, one with a mild clutter of electronics and the
other filled with papers and writing utensils. It's well lit here, the lamps
on each desk giving it a warm, non-abrasive glow.

deep blue strokes. An altar sits on the slate in the center of the room.
