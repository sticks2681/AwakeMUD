   This is one hell of a nice elevator. Saying that, Renraku can afford to
give you the absolute best up to a certain point. The plush velvet carpet
ruffles under your feet, and you can almost see your own reflection in the
shining silver walls. To help you around, there's a floor directory on the
wall.

   This appears to be one of the richer apartments, although even that does
not compare to what most people know of Renraku's wealth. This place is simply
adequate living quarters for another one of the company's lackies that merely
runs from his home to the coffee machine every day.

about as good as it gets. What gives this place its location, is simply its
clientele. For some strange reason, the darkness and anonymity attracts a
large crowd of corporate suits and wealthy playboys.

   Renraku is mainly known for its prowess in computer systems, and this floor
and the hundreds of rooms it's made of, are all dedicated to such feats.
Renraku takes pride in the dedication and meticulous precision of all its
engineers and machines, relying on them to advance each working hour against
the competitors all over the world. The floor spreads out as far as the eye
can see, with booths, workbenches, factory lines and all other instalments
scattered in cohesive groups.

   A plush hallway leads you past various wall-hung holopics, all depicting a
powerful, dominating Renraku Trideo department. And that's not too far from
the truth. There's an elevator call panel against the far wall.

   What a madhouse. Trideo is considerably busier than the Simsense
department, simply because of the vast difference in produced volume. These
guys work round the clock, just to make sure that the channels are kept up to
date with the latest Renraku transmissions.

   An important room. Understatement of the last ten centuries. Renraku's most

of scanning the place out, several guards come and close the blinds on you.

different passageways open up. There's an elevator call panel against the far

   It's only right to expect a security terminal, no? Just under half of
Renraku's major security concerns and countermeasures lie in the Matrix, and
thus these guys have the few major access points to Renraku's security
interface. Even if you were able to get anywhere near it, the computer screen
looks incredibly complex, and it isn't even in English.

Name:	Guard Point Delta
Desc:$
   Whatever you've come up against up to now, forget it. This guard point
looks like Fort Knox on Red Alert. And those guys look calm. About 12 guards
stand in a circle, around a plated guard post. The hallway stops here, and
instead junctions, splitting the corridor north and south. To the east the way
is blocked by a heavy, secured metal door which leads into the depths of the
Renraku higher-ups' houses.

   Being oriental in descent, Huang has opted for the traditional black and
gold motif, applying himself to a more sexy, powerful, and generally cooler
approach. The reception, as you might as well call it, displays probably just
a small fraction of the apartment's wealth, but doesn't do a bad job of it
anyway.

   Noone knows that much about this guy. He's the biggest recluse of all four
directors, and prefers to stay out of the limelight as much as possible. The
apartment, funnily enough, reflects this side of him incredibly well. The
reception doesn't hold that much interest, and though you daren't venture into
the other rooms, they all look like rather bland formations of red, green, and
black varying furniture.

   This hallway, unlike most of the others, actually smells of power. The
carpet is impeccably clean, and the walls look like they were painted
yesterday. A soothing tune of 20th century classical music drifts through the
corridor, chiming almost in complete time with the flickering of the lamps
that line the top of the walls.

   Really be careful here. As you approach the security checkpoint, almost
every single one of the guards that was sitting down, jumps to attention and
strolls "casually" towards you. Any faint movements without explicit purpose
might just give them a reason to erase you completely.

   The security post almost leaps out at you with activity, and don't be
surprised if that's actually very true. The guards are all trained to sniff
you out and stare you down until you crack up and splash tears on their boots.
Your best bet, is to approach these people with *valid* identification.

   Take a deep breath. This room makes decisions that topple governments, that
create conspiracy theories, that kill people. The four giants that convene at
the enormous table in the center of the room pave the way for civilization as
we know it every day. Each wall houses a huge rig of trideo screens, in order
for each director to get a perfect view of current events, and current
clients. Around the rigs, a thick ring of sound-speakers lie dormant. Above
you, powerful halogen lamps beam down on you without the slightest humm or
buzz. In the corners of the room, huge camera pods stare you down almost as
soon as you enter. However, it isn't the cameras that really catch your
attention. It's the huge twin cannons on either side of the cameras that are
also locked in on your position.

   You are in a short hallway that heads either north or south.  The walls are
a pleasing light green color, although the effect is somewhat diminished by
the blood stains.  A sign on the wall across from the elevator reads "Level 13
Hospital".

   Words are barely enough to encompass the sheer majesty of the building
ahead of you. Gleaming silver walls, refracting light as if they were in
motion, plant themselves in curved bases at each corner of the arcology, and
reach hundreds of stories up into the sky. Along the ascent, your eyes catch
innumerable stepped balconies and windows overlooking downtown Seattle. Lights
glitter on each floor like gold dust in the distance. Around the outside of
the building, trees, benches and sculptures adorn the promenades that encircle
the North and South entrances. The sight before you is not unlike a mecca for
the modern consumer. The average intake of customers, clients and residents
here baffles any other numbers in competition. Truly, the glory of this
corporation can be in no doubt when your eyes take in the sheer grandeur of
this admirable structure.

generators that are a room over. Techs are everywhere dressed in their flashy
nuclear containment suits. A system of lighting around the room changes color
with the levels of radiation in the room. White being safe, Blue is borderline
safety, and Red is nuclear contamination.

   The catwalk turns with the room here continuing along the outer perimiter
of the room. Below the catwalk are banks of computers that help to monitor and
control the reactors in the center of the room. A little farther north the
catwalk turns into stairs that lead down to the main floor.

   A large thermonuclear reactor towers over you here with a bank of computers
circling it. A small window gives view into the main chamber of the reactor
where the plutonium rods are held. Large ducts run up about 10 feet before
curving and running off to the east and through the wall to the generators.
There is a heavy steel door that leads into the inner chamber but it has been
welded shut. The reactor for the most part is circled by banks of computers
that monitor every aspect of the reactors status. There is a single part of
the reactor that is low tech. The coolant and rod control are still controlled
via valve openers.
