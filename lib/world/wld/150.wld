Name:	A Terribly maintained Waiting room
Desc:$
   This waiting room had more than obviously been left to for the Scumbags and
trash who dared braving it into the establishment, the concrete floors cracked
and unwashed, littered with used blt chips and other bits and peices of trash,
a few rats peek into view from time time. The walls were made of a
drywall-like substance, most of which was either peeling or decomposing,
giving the room the musty smell of molded wooden supports. A few bent and half
broken seats are scattered around the room, most of which are lying on their
sides, one of them sprawled out right beside an old coagulated pool of blood,
Perhaps what remains of the last chump who tried their Luck with this place..?
The only ways out of the place are the way you came In, and a Single thick
reinforced door on the other side of the room.

Name:	A surprising change from the Waiting room
Desc:$
   This was a surprising turn in style to say the least, This well lit hallway
seemed almost spotless, from its freshly drywalled (most likely reinforced)
walls, to its newly italian marble tiled floor. Even the trim that ran the
along its length on the bottom and halfway up the wall had been painstakingly
detailed and carved, polished and from the looks of it recently dusted. A few
double-barred halogen lights are anchored into the ceiling and hang down a few
inches, those as well running down along the hallway towards a few set of
doors.

Name:	The hallway splits off
Desc:$
   This room is much like the one you entered from, save for the fact that it
now that its exits branch off. Exits lead both to the left and to the right,
the doorway infront of you is covered with a jet black beaded string door,
blocking off your view further north. The smell of burning incense seems to be
wafting in past the beads.

Name:	On the other side of the Two-way Mirror
Desc:$
This room was more than obviously the center nerve system for the establishment, although it was hard to see due to the dim lightning conditions. There were no windows that were noticable, and only a single slitted vent bolted into the ceiling for ventalition purposes. An odd hum catches your ear, the sound of white noise generators no doubt? The first half of the floor was tiled black and white italian marble design of an ominous and terrifying looking black dragon conquering a knight in shining armor, a little macabe for some peoples tastes perhaps. The walls were done in a gun-metal black like paint, a few shaded and dimmed halogen lights offering what little light they could. A few rather expensive looking paintings line the wall, along with the paintings of a few well known, and even lesser known Night-Ones throughout the past. Beyond the tiling was a short fur rug that pretty much covered the rest of the floor, square in its center was a lengthy and rather tastfully crafted desk, a few papers scattered across its surface.

meet, and ofcourse they're full attention is most likely upon you.

mannequins wearing heavy combat and tactical peices of equipment and armor.
Some of the lockers are open and present the onlooker with quite a display in
firepower, while others are tightly locked with highlevel maglocks and
combination locks, even some time-locks are apparent. The walls, ceiling, and
floor are made of solid concrete, the door from whence he came a giant slab of
