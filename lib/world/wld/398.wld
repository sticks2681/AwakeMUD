Name:	Parking Lot of Lysleul Plaza
Desc:$
   A massive parking lot streches before you, providing parking spaces to an
even larger shopping complex ahead of you. Lysleul Plaza, known for luxury
goods it supplies as well as for its artistic architectural design, is one of
the most "tres chic" establishments known in the UCAS. Lysleul Plaza
celebrates the accomplishments of humanity before the Awakening drastically
changed the world, and as such, caters for the needs of humans, though the
Plaza still services metahumans.
   The Plaza is flanked by an ornately decorated apartment complex to the west
and a flashy nightclub to the east.

Name:	Lysleul Square, Southeast corner
Desc:$
   Lysleul Plaza has a reputation for catering to the needs of the rich, and
the standard seems to be upheld based on the appearance of the crowds of
shoppers around you, all dressed to appear like members of the elite class of
society. The entryway to Lysleul Sqare, the center of the entire luxury
complex, is decorated with exotic wildlife. Fences surround various species of
exotic plants which fill the air with an uplifting aroma. Animals can be seen
behind glass safety cages, some magical by nature, but most not Awakened. 
   A glass ceiling provides natural sunlight to fill Lysleul Plaza during the
day, and various lights set up on balconies overlooking the Square illuminate
the Plaza at night, in addition to providing a fabulous light show.

   Lysleul Square is centered on the single, extravagent ^Ccrystalline^N fountain.
Shoppers pass by the fountain on their way from shop to shop, some allowing
their children to stare at the exotic fish dwelling in the aquarium at the
base of the fountain. The water from the fountain gushes upward towards the
glass ceiling. Lights underneath the surface of the water shine towards the
geysers of water, creating a beautiful water projection with the fountain.

Desc:$
   This store is a horticulturalist's dream come true. The air in the room is
noticably warmer, and a complex air conditioning system regulates the
temperatures surrounding various species of plants. The glass ceiling allows
for natural sunlight to shine upon the plants and flowers being grown inside
the shop, and a spiraling staircase leads to a second balcony where additional
plants can be grown undisturbed by the customers that frequent this shop.  A
captivating young Elf stands next to a potted plant: her hands glow as she
holds them over the flower buds and she appears to be whispering to the
flowers themselves. So that's how the flowers from this store grow so well..

restaurant, has effectively sealed off the establishment from outside noise,
namely Jad's nightclub to the east. The entire restaurant reeks of high class
decor: crystal chandeliers, a soft, beige wall paper, Greco-Roman columns and
architecture, marble engravings of cherubs, angels, and devas. The atmosphere
in the room is pleasantly cool, a stark contrast to the the nightclub right
across the hallway.  This dining area is right below an elevated platform,
where a small orchestra is playing classical music.

Desc:$
   This section of the dining area is elevated slightly to overlook the rest
of the restaurant. A waiter attends to your every need, and a small orchestra
off to the side fills the restaurant with pleasant Classical music. Cherub
engravings at the sides of this area spout pleasant streams of water from
their mouths into crystal clear fountains.

   Jad stocks quite a hefty amount of alcohol, and tries his best to cater to
everyone's tastes. From vintage bottles of fine wine to the hardest Formula
666, Jad probably has at least one bottle of it lying around. While not as
successful or runner-oriented as Dante's Inferno across town, Jad's Nightclub
does pretty well, and doesn't have a very big profile.

   The moshing gets more intense the closer you get to the stage, and you're
sure you're going to develop bruises in the morning. The music from the band
is unbearably loud, but this section of the nightclub is where the pure
experience of nightclubbing can be felt. You could climb onto the stage and
rock with the band if you'd like.

group performs on a nightly basis. A smokey haze of cannibus is present on the
stage: apparently it helps the band members perform better. From the stage,

Name:	In a Private Booth Overlooking the Dancefloor
Desc:$
    The private booth is built into the wall, and is on an elevated platform
overlooking the dance floor. A wax candle in the center of the round wooden
table illuminates the inside of the booth with a flickering glow. Soft,
leather seats make the booth pretty comfortable to sit in, and booth offers a
view of the entire dance floor and the performance stage.

Name:	By the Bar on the Second Floor
Desc:$
      Jad stocks quite a hefty amount of alcohol, and tries his best to cater
to everyone's tastes. From vintage bottles of fine wine to the hardest Formula
666, Jad probably has at least one bottle of it lying around. While not as
successful or runner-oriented as Dante's Inferno across town, Jad's Nightclub
does pretty well, and doesn't have a very big profile.  The bar stools near
the railing overlook the entire dance floor, including the two metal dancing
cages.

die a kiss and tosses them into the air. Groans of disappointment and cheers
of excitement are both audible around these tables, as are the sounds of the
plastic chips as they continuously change hands.

Name:	By the Roulette Tables
Desc:$
   Tension and anxiety are constantly in the air around the roulette tables as
the roulette ball gradually comes to a stop on a fateful number. The
torturing,  spinning noise is enough to drive some people insane. Best not to
play this game unless you can actually handle it..

Name:	By the Blackjack Tables
Desc:$
   A simple game with simple rules, blackjack attracts the novices of the
gambling scene. However, the adept members of the gambling scene still
frequent the tables when they're in the mood for a simple game, and high-stake
games with these people are not uncommon. Good game to play if you like the
thrill of having your life savings depending on a single card.

Name:	By the Poker Tables
Desc:$
   The true casino game of kings, poker requires much more than a simple luck
of the draw. Precise analysis of the reactions of the opponents is also
essential to being successful at poker. The ability to make cards transparent
is quite rare, however, as is the ability to make your own telltale signs of a
bluff. Poker is also a game testing restraint and temperance. Now.. are you
going to play, or what?

   Yet another simple game, Baccarat is similar to Blackjack, except the
player places bets on which hand he thinks will win. A fairly simple game, but
like Blackjack, is much more complex than it seems, hence the poor bewildered
soul that just passed by you with a now empty wallet.

   Paradise is the first word that comes to mind. The entire floor has been
decorated with a tropical island motiff, with leafy palm trees decorating the
entire level. The floor has been covered with a large amount of sand to
simulate a beach, and the special lights on the ceiling imitate natural
sunlight almost perfectly.  A bikini clad receptionist sits behind the
counter, scheduling massage appointments in this levels' many private rooms.

      A massive indoor swimming pool is in the center of the room. The warm,
pleasant water is also piped in from natural springs like the spas downstairs,
and have been through an extensive series of purification filters, resulting
in a pool that doesn't require the itchy, unpleasant treatment of chlorine.
Dark blue ceramic tiles surround the pool and lead off through a row of tall
glass doors onto balconies outside.

   The stone bridge crosses the pond, providing access to the forest from the
lake. Water lilies float along beneath the bridge from the momentum of the
water disrupted by the passing of the swimming ducks. Cherry blossom trees
planted next to the bridge send pink flowers drifting into the air and onto
the surface of the water. A weeping willow tree drapes its droopy tendrils
over a portion of the bridge.

   The ^Cwater^N streams down from the north, colliding into the rocks jutting out
from the river. The sound of running water fills the air, creating a tranquil

Desc:$
   Clear ^Cblue water^N crashes down from the cliff above, forming the river that
runs down a long way towards the Lysleul Gardens. The running water forms a
churning pool at the base of the cliff. Sunlight shines against the falling
water and forms a slight ^Rr^ya^Yi^Gn^Cb^Bo^Rw^N as the light is refracted off the surface of
the water.

Name:	Underneath the Waterfall
Desc:$
   Pushing past the falling water, you arrive at a large, secluded cavern
underneath the waterfall. The sound of falling water drowns out all other
noise from the environment. A crystal clear pool of water formed from the
water from the waterfall reflects flawlessly like a mirror. A large, flat
stone is in the center of the chamber, looking out toward the waterfall.

Name:	Under the Firespray T-bird
Desc:$
   The T-bird before you has been outfitted to become any smuggler's dream
plane. The aerodynamic, sleek design of the craft, combined with the four
engines mounted on the wings and the rear of the uber-jet make this little
gunship look like it can blast through any border patrol in existance. A pair
of vicious-looking autocannons are mounted under the nose of the plane, and
twin missile racks are located near the bases of the wings. A single rotating
autocannon mount is located in the rear of the T-bird, but the autocannon is
strangely missing. A print of a gorgeous brunette in a bikini has been
emblazoned on the side of the vehicle, riding a wicked-looking electric guitar
that's shaped like a rocket between her legs. A hatchway leads into the
interior of the vehicle.

Name:	Inside a Firespray T-bird
Desc:$
   The interior of the Firespray t-bird is rather roomy, with a few storage
compartments built into the walls and floor of the flight craft. A few of the
panels in the wall seem to be loose, and some circuits peep out from
underneath the floorboards, but this T-bird looks like it can move faster than
anything with an engine. In the rear area, two benches allow four people to
sit, while the front area has a pair of seats for the pilot and copilot. A
pair of fuzzy red dice hang from the ceiling over the pilot's chair, and a
bobble head doll of Mick Jagger is on the dashboard.
