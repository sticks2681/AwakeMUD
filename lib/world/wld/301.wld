Name:	An abandoned corner of the Junkyard
Desc:$
   A blackened hole in the ground opens before you, belching smoke and foul
vapors from below ground. Exposed fibres and other wiring promise a nasty
electric shock if you stray too close, and the plascrete around the mouth of
the hole is blackened and chewed. An old maintenance ladder leads inside.

   An old abandoned sewer tunnel. The pipe is barely large enough to stand in,
and the sides are slippery with algae and less pleasant things. You stand

black, grainy sludge. A faint dirt path leads west towards the exit and east
deeper into the park.

could be harvested from. Well, if you weren't depressed before, you certainly

   The poverty of the area can be seen in abundance, with most of the
buildings cracked shells of what they once were. Squatters and vandals have
reduced the once-pleasant look of the neighborhood to that of a combat zone.
However, to the south is a building that has been beautifully maintained, and
gleams like a beacon through the filth. No vandal in his right mind would
touch this building, and for good reason. Over the door hangs a neon sign:

countermeasure, which doesn't make it a particular great place to loiter
around in if possible, especially with the Ares SentryGun(TM) turrets
overlooking the area. South is the parking lot and north is the foyer.

   Grady Way is a shadow of its former self, that much can be discerned from a
single glance, it may have even been nice a few decades ago, but certainly not
anymore. The smell of pollution from the nearby industrial complexes has
permanently given the area a light haze of smog, which threatens to cling to
every surface it can manage, though some of the buildings have kept it at bay
to keep up appearances. To the north towers a massive rectangular building,
surrounded by a monowire-topped fence. Grady Way extends eastward towards the
rest of Renton.

Name:	Grady Way
Desc:$
   Grady Way was one a broad avenue that cut through the commercial and
industrial complexes of Renton, having seen much better days in the decades
past. The ever present smog being churned out by the nearby industries has
left it blackened with grime and there's a light haze in the air that attests
to its presence. Attempts to liven up the area with shrubbery and planted
trees along the sides of the road have been only somewhat successful, as it
seems that they aren't all that well taken care of, which shouldn't be too
much of a surprise since most people have all but given up on expecting
anything other than what it currently is. The Knight Errant Academy looms over
the skyline to the west, while off to the east some nightclubs and restaurants
can be found.

   Blackened trees and wilting, dying plants make up Cedar River Park, which
kind of defeats the purpose of calling it one, though once upon a time,
decades ago, it used to be an actual park. It barely qualifies as a parking
lot nowadays. The ground is littered with trash, shell casings, needles, BTL
chips, and assorted other debris. All in all, not a good spot for a picnic.

small shrubs battle valiantly against the toxins and pollutants in the air

from the industrial sector has coated everything with a thin layer of thick
black grime, which there have been made some half-assed attempts to clean up,
with little to show for it. To the west, the road heads into the populated
area of Renton, where the squat monster of the Knight Errant Training Facility
towers over the other buildings. East leads towards Cedar River Park and the
slums that surround it.

Name:	The Kitchen
Desc:$
   This large, clean kitchen is filled with the delicious smells of garlic,
basil, tomatoes, cream, warm bread and onions. Large pots of soup boil on the
massive gas stove top that takes up an entire wall. A huge brick wood-fired
pizza and bread oven dominates the middle of the room, and a huge dishwasher
takes up the wall to your left.

   The Hunting Lodge is one of two dining rooms of the Italiano. It is done in
dark synthoak panelling, and a pair of windows looks out on Renton. Several
large round tables are surrounded by straight-backed blue leather chairs. A
huge fireplace contains a real wood fire, and the skins of a zebra and a lion
are laid out on the floor as rugs. Most of the patrons here look decidedly
shady.

   The Red Room is one of two dining rooms in the Italiano. It is dominated by
several large, dark tables surrounded by comfortable leather-backed wood
chairs. The walls are painted a dusky glowing red, and a picture window looks
out on Renton. A massive trideo set in the corner shows an endless string of
old flat-vid gangster movies on mute. The tables are heaped with platters of
pasta and garlic bread, and bottles and glasses are strewn everywhere. Most of
the room's occupants are large, sinister-looking men in flashy suits.

glass-topped coffee tables stand between groups of overstuffed red leather
armchairs. The smell of fresh espresso fills the air, and the accordian music
is soothing and shot through with sounds of conversational Italian. The
majority of the restaurant's patrons seem to be male, large and dressed in
expensive, flashy suits. They also seem to be sporting gold chains and bulges
under their arms.

Desc:$
   This is the entryway to the Italiano, Renton's swankiest Italian restaurant
and social club. The atmosphere is warm and homey, and the walls are hung with
prints of Italy. The building itself is laid out like a cross, and consists of
the entryway in which you now stand, a lounge, two private dining rooms, and
the kitchen. Accordion music is being piped in over the bleeding-edge sound
system.

Name:	Grady Way
Desc:$
   Grady Way is one of Renton's main thorough fares, and this particular block
is one of the tensest spots in the district. To the north is the Murdered
Mime, a nightclub that serves as a hangout and proving ground for young Yakuza
soldiers of the Shotozumi-gumi. South is the Italiano, a social club and
restaurant frequented by members of the Bigio Mafia family. The street between
the two sees a shootout at least twice a week, which explains the random
scatterings of spent catridges and shells found on the streets and sidewalks.

Name:	The Murdered Mime
Desc:$
   You stand in the entryway to a neo-disco techno club. The entire room is
done in checkered black and white, shot through with shining surgical steel. A
crowd of young people, almost exclusively Asian humans, bump and grind to the
thundering techno beat coming from concealed speakers. The bass jars your
spine, and strobe lights in a variety of neon colors assault your eyes. The
dancefloor is set below floor level, so all that is visible of the dancers is
a mass of writhing torsos, heads, and arms. The plasticrete chessboard floor
around the dancers is polished to a glossy shine, and several tables are set
away from the dancefloor up against the walls. A massive ebony and chrome bar
is set up across the room against the far wall.

Desc:$
   The dancefloor seethes with energy. It's accessed by small stairways at
each of the four cardinal directions, and is surrounded by four-foot high
walls that are covered in black-and-white synthetic carpeting. The dancefloor
itself is made up of bottom-lit white and black squares. A bank of lights
sends beams of color over the bodies of the dancers around you. The air is
thick with body heat and sweat, and it is difficult to breathe.

   This well-lit hallway follows the same decor choices as the others that
feed into it, as apparently the designer was rather fond of the contrasting
colour choices. There's more of the same as far as the holopics and plaques
are concerned, though a few of them have addendums on them, most likely due to
their owners having lost their lives in the line of duty. The hallway
continues into the building to the north, and back towards the foyer to the
west.

perhaps that's the entire point to it? The same procession of holopics and
plaques for notable Knight-Errant Academy graduates line the walls, instilling
a sense of purpose for trainees, which also works as a subversive
psychological tool to integrate students into the fold.

#30187
Name:	MacMillan Lane
Desc:$
   MacMillan ends in a T-junction with Grady Way to the south, and proceeds
north towards a hulking industrial facility that looms over the area like a
bad omen. Almost all of the businesses around here are vacant and the
buildings are either under renovation or sitting abandoned as reminders of
what was once a productive industrial sector in Renton.

Name:	MacMillan at the Federated Boeing Industrial Complex
Desc:$
   MacMillan terminates abruptly at a massive steel gate, atop which are
heavily reinforced guard towers just in case anyone is stupid enough to try
their luck and enter uninvited. It appears to be firmly locked, which is
likely for the best since their security makes most megacorps look like mall
security. The only path leads south towards Grady Way, and the commercial
sector of Renton.

Name:	Alamais' Lair
Desc:$
   A massive cavern of raw stone stretches in every direction. The ceiling is
over eighty feet, vaulted and streaked with precious metals. Gemstones and
formica glitter from the walls, and everything glistens with a coating of dark
green algae. The smooth granite floor is scarred with gouges from the massive
claws of the room's occupant. The algae on the walls emits an eerie green
phosphorescent light, filling the room with pockets of shadow.

Name:	Underground Temple
Desc:$
   A massive underground temple has been carved out of the rock. While the
walls are rough stone, the floor has been covered with huge slabs of varnished
slate. On this, myriad arcane designs have been engraved and filled with
bright crimson paint. The room is illuminated by scores of torches mounted in
sconces around the walls at intervals of two feet. The air is filled with the
smells of incense, sweat, and blood. The far wall is dominated by an enormous
statue of a grinning demon head with fluted horns and meter-long teeth. His
large ^Reyes^N are slitted maniacally, and several human skulls have been set
halfway into the concrete platform on which it sits. In front of the statue is
a jet black stone altar. It sports an elaborate set of chains and restraints,
and is covered with crimson symbols that seem to pulse and glow. A heavy black
trapdoor is set into the floor at the northwest corner of the room.
