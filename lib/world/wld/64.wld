Name:	The Lobby
Desc:$
   This shabby area looks more like a homeless shelter than the lobby it
actually is. The walls have been stripped of any resemblance of paint by time,
weather, and the local residents. The mail boxes and any furniture have long
since been demolished or stolen.

Name:	The Office
Desc:$
   This is the run down office that gets used by the complex manager. It has
an old gunmetal grey metal desk and chair. There is a very old terminal here
for handling records of leases. The walls here still have the latest coat of
paint due to the fact the door is usually closed and the manager sleeps here
most nights.

   This hallway on the south side is practically a duplicate of the north
corridor. It has the same lighting and the same dirty windows although one
here is broken providing a bit more light.

   This corner is just like those on the north side of the building. It is
piled just as high with trash and is just as dark and dreary. The only
difference is which way the corridors run from the corner. This corner leads
into the entrance hallway to the north.

The apartment gives off the scent of body odor and junk food, giving the
impression the occupant spends quite a lot of time here. Tatami mats on the
floor are a stark contrast to the dull peeling wallpaper. A desk sits against
one wall, supporting a desktop computer attached to numerous cookers of
various manufactuer.

Name:	A damp basement
Desc:$
   This is a very damp basement. There are no real furnishings to speak of in
this well hidden hole in the ground. There is a heavy metal counter across
the room about half way way into the room. Above that hangs a screen of heavy
metal mesh. Behind the counter are several racks containing old wooden ammo
boxes of various sizes. One side of the room holds a long table that has a lot
of ammunition loading equipment stacked all over it.
