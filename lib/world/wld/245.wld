Name:	The Rooster's Coop
Desc:$
   The first thing one expects when walking into this establishment has to be
a face full of hot lead. Everything is displayed behind cages and sturdy
display cases, leaving small aisles for customers to stroll through and look
over the merchandise. Security is a big concern, for patrons that is, because
this place is stacked to the brim with reasons not to give the employees
trouble, which is a big plus for its location in the barrens. Twin automated
defense turrets swivel and cover the entire storefront, tearing anyone stupid
enough to try and rob this place into little more than brightly coloured
confetti. The Rooster's Coop is well known as a place to unload firearms and
ammunition, and has earned a reputation from its mostly ganger clients as
being a reasonable place to exchange for cred, which almost matches it
reputation for putting the hurt on anyone dumb enough to screw around.

Name:	Back in The Rooster's office
Desc:$
   This back room is supposed to be an office, but, its more like a storage
room. Stacks of old surplus ammo crates line the walls, which are covered in
old propeganda posters from back in the 'Good Ol' USA' days. Quite a number of
them are downright racist, such as the 'Slap A Jap' campaign, along with
phrases such as "The only good gook is a dead gook". Apparently The Rooster
wears his heart on his sleeve, and isn't shy about his racism in the
slightest. Bits and pieces of firearms are strewn out across what flat work
space can be found, some of which are being cleaned, while others are in the
process of being put back together. Plenty of guns can be seen laying around
the place, most of which are within easy reach of the owners very capable
hands, making it enough reason to leave well enough alone. A single steel
door, heavily draped with locks, is almost hidden along the far northern wall.

Name:	A basement used for storage
Desc:$
   This basement has been constructed from thick slabs of rebar reinforced
concrete, making it a veritable bomb shelter. Its currently being used to
store The Rooster's personal stash of weapons and ammunition hes been
collecting over the years, and he apparently goes through quite a deal of
trouble to keep undeserving eyes and fingers off of them. Line after line of
rifles are stacked along the walls and locked away behind display cases and
chainlink security measures. Boxes of ammunition are pushed up along the far
wall, as if this were a staging ground for some unforeseen war to come.

Name:	A short concrete hallway
Desc:$
   This short hallway has walls of smooth concrete, with very little else to
see aside from an occasional crate of ammunition waiting around to be stored.
A single bare light bulb hangs down from the ceiling near the back, its beaded
draw string swaying about above the only other exit leading out of here. A
large set of heavy metal doors are set into the ground, tightly bolted and
built into the foundation itself. It would prove almost impossible to break
through, and the series of heavy padlocks makes it all but useless to attempt
picking.
