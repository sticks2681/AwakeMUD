#31549
Name:	The Office of Exodous.
Desc:$
   This office is rather nicely appointed in wood and dark rich colors of
brown and green. Wood paneled walls hung with various pictures and newspaper
clippings dominate the surrounding area with the exception of a large picture
window in the western wall which opens upon a view of a rather large forested
area. Loamy brown carpet, plush and thick seems to swollow footsteps and the
room has an aspect of privacy, even echoes seem to be non-existant. A leather
couch off in one corner supplies comfortable seating space for guests,
interviewees, whatever, and a large highbacked leather chair rests behind the
dest for Ex to sit in. The only uncomfortable thing in the room is a small
plaque on his desk in the shape of a grenade, glued to the pin of the grenade
is a slip of plastic with the number 1 on it.

#31550
Name:	The Outlaws Mansion
Desc:$
   The sound of your footfalls echo as you move through the cavernous main
hall of the outlaws mansion. massive red stone columns carved into the shape
of mythical beasts rise up  from the obsidian marble tiled, red grouted floor
to support the vaulted ceiling, a circular  skylight casting luminance upon a
large crystal fountain in the center of the hall with a  large golden globe on
top with "The World is Ours" etched into it. Portraits adorn the
creme-colored marble walls with the names Abigor, Reidain, Cordt, and
Dooberous  delicately inscribed upon golden plaques beneath them. A long table
sits near the  fountain with several large, comfortable looking wooden chairs
surrounding it. The chairs at either end of the table are slightly larger, and
have the names "Reidain" and "Abigor" embossed upon the high backrests
respectively. The table itself is adorned with two  candelabras, hand crafted
into the shape of impressive stallions. farther along, a twin  staircase leads
up to a landing before a set of dungeonesque double doors identical  to those
at the entryway, metal studs adorning the frame.
