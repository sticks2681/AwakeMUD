Name:	Tore-Up Road
Desc:$
   You take a turn off to the northeast toward Cascade Ork. Theres a great
deal of traffic coming in and out of the small Salish Tribe known for its
mining and smuggling. In fact its likely that much of your black market gear
stopped at Cascade Ork at one time. The Salish council allows this smuggling
to take place since it is mostly headed towards Seattle and they receive
massive amounts of money from the T-Bird jockeys flying in and out of the
Mountain community. As if to prove a point a Stream-lined black and red jet
thunders by just a few feet above the treetops.

Desc:$
   The asphalt here has been ripped up a bit more than usual and off to the
side of the road you can see why as a home-made armored vehicle lies in a heap
of rusting parts and the remnants of multiple weapons the usable parts long
since cannibalized to make one of the many patched together weapons popular
among gangers and squatters. The wreck looks to have been sitting their for
perhaps a decade and looks to be occupied by a family of squatters. Further up
the road lies the settlement itself.

Name:	Fork In The Tore-Up Road
Desc:$
   The road takes two directions here. It is apparent that you are in Cascade
Ork territory now due to the fact that nearly everyone you see is an Ork or
Troll and those that aren't appear to be smugglers or AmerIndian Humans and
Dwarves from Cascade Crow. The east leads to a more low lying area green with
grass and cut into with small streams. In that area, from this vantage, flocks
of hundreds of sheep can be seen grazing along with huge Troll and Ork
shepherds armed with heavy weaponry in order to protect their flocks from
bandits in search of real meat. The burning remains of a Harley Scorpion off
to the side of them is a testament to their skill. The north becomes more and
more rocky and the lights of a landing strip on a nearby plateau can be seen,
as well as numerous homes built into the rock face of the nearby mountains.
Paths leading to caves from the landing strip seem to have been made into
hangers.

Name:	Grazing Area
Desc:$
   You have headed down into a small valley dotted with shallow streams and
very little trees and forest animals. It's farm country, and due to the
rareness of real meat, the Ork and Troll guards looking over the sheep look
like two tons of trouble, so it might be in your best interest not to frag
around with their flocks. Nearly all the sheep have black wool and through
selective breeding and genetic manipulation are much larger than most sheep,
standing at shoulder-height to an average human chest. They are obviously bred
to be able to satisfy a Troll's appetite, as well as producing enough wool to
make Troll- and Ork-sized clothing. Rams are spread throughout the flock and
one look at their nasty horns tells you that you probably don't want to tangle
with one. Dog Shamans wander through the area followed by Hell Hounds trained
to be sheep dogs, as well as being a deterrent to any would-be sheep thieves.
You are watched closely as you walk through the area... Maybe you shouldn't
try for some lamb chops.

Name:	Nearing The Mines
Desc:$
   As you head more towards the bulk of Cascade Ork, you notice the path
branching off to multiple areas. To the northeast, the smugglers flock around
a bar, as well as the landing strip and hangars built into the mountain side.
Multiple T-Birds are being taxied down the into the hangers from the landing
strip. To the direct west, a large turqouise building lays with Ork Guards
watching the entrance. Closer examination reveals this as Ork Rights
Coalition(ORC) Headquarters. ORC has been led the last few years by a powerful
Cat shaman named Patti Dewar(more commonly known as Pita to the shadow
community). To the north lies more residential areas built into the mountain
side, as well as what appears to be mine shafts.

Desc:$
   You head deeper into the valley past a few small streams here and there
until you stumble across dozens of black tents that look to be made of the
wool of the hundreds of sheep sorrounding you. To the south it looks as if a
few shepherds are shearing the wooly creatures while others sit around a
campfire to the east. In general, most of the people here are friendly, if not
a little suspicious. It's important to note that with all the security around
here that starting a fight would likely be a very bad idea.

Desc:$
   Six shearers stand here, armed with mono-knives of all things, expertly
slicing through the fuzzy mess of the sheep and filling up crates, which are
then transported up north to the more industry-minded areas of Cascade Ork.
The shearers look extremely dangerous, as they are able to slice off the wool
within a minute without harming the sheep. If they had so desired, you imagine
they could flay you just as easily. Off to the east lies the largest of the
black tents.

   A scrawny Ork dressed in stitched together reptile skins sits in the middle

is thick in the air. With every step you must take care not to crush any of
the creatures. The shearers, butchers and other farm workers who pass in and
out of the tent seem to treat this figure with a great amount of respect. It
seems this must be Skink, the Chief Shaman for Cascade Ork, who also happens
to be in charge of looking over the Tribe's farming activities. A powerful
Lizard Shaman, Skink is also armed with a 10 gauge Mossberg that looks quite
capable of changing your ambitions.

families telling stories, roasting a lamb leg over the fire and all around
relaxing. Despite their relaxed natures, the off-duty guards still carry their
weapons and look quite capable of moving into action to defend their
livestock. The largest of the black tents is set up to the south. The
atmosphere here is one of relaxation and brotherhood.

over the slaughter of the sheep, casting spells to soothe the animals before a
bloodied butcher slits their throats, and goes about his business of carving
the animal up. The parts are then wrapped in platic and put in crates to be
taken up north to be sterilized. There is a pile of unpackaged flesh that
apparently will be eaten by the shepherds and their families.

if they were mass-produced, so you doubt someone actually went to the work of

with the doors and ceiling dimensions. There are numerous flyers to pick up
here, each stating facts to point out the degree of racism shown to Orks and
Trolls still today. Most everyone here wears pins like "Bash Back!", "Kiss Me,
I'm A Troll!", "Trog Power!", and other pro-ORC statements . Despite the heavy
pro-Troll and pro-Ork sentiment here, people of all races are treated with
respect. Stairs lead upwards to Patti Dewar's office, and the pounding sound
of a Meta Madness concert can be heard to the west, where a large auditorium
can be seen as well as dozens of ork and troll concert fans. There is a
counter here where one can buy pro-Troll and pro-Ork clothing as well as Meta
Madness merchandise.

Name:	Meta Madness Concert!
Desc:$
   The music has been cranked to absurd levels as Meta Madness plays this
small venue on an auditorium stage to the north. The 'Trog Chrome Punk' band
was one of the first to kick start the Trog metal scene and are likely the
best. The lead singer, Paul Foster, or Mad Paul as he's known on stage, is a
ex-ganger who turned to a life of political activism, instead of staying on
the mean streets of Seattle's Ork Underground. Blending a mixture of Techno
metal(or chrome) and savage political punk lyrics in the vein of Anti-Flag,
Meta Madness has been on top of the Trog Metal scene since the mid-50s,
touring with such bands as Tyranical Trogs, Tusk Fragger, The Grunges, and
even rap groups like Crazed Urban Trogs(or CUT). Currently the floor is
covered with a mixture of moshing and slam-dancing Trolls and Orks kicking
their legs and pumping their fists in time with the music. There is a little
bit of blood on the floor in this sea of violence, but when someone falls down
theres another Ork or Troll to help them up and keep them from being crushed.

Name:	On Stage
Desc:$
   After haphazard moments of crowd surfing, diving and pushing, you've
managed to make it on stage where Mad Paul is screaming out the lyrics to
"Bash Back!", a song made popular in the late 50's during a rash of Ork
slayings that eventually led to the conviction of two Lone Star officers for
the murders of three ork youths. This song quickly became a hit with its
catchy chant/chorus of "Bash Back If You Want To Live! Bash Back If You Want
To Win! Bash Back To Destroy The SIN!!!", (referring to the System
Identification Number, which most orks and trolls claim keep them as
second-class citizens[A claim backed up by the fact that fewer than 100 orks
and trolls born naturally have SINs]). In any case, there's only one way back
now, and that's to jump into the mass of spinning and jabbing ork and troll
limbs.

   WHOOOOO-HA! You soar through the air before landing on the waiting hands of
Meta Madness fans, cradling your body about two meters above the floor.  You
now swim above the crowd, trying to maneuver yourself along the sea of arms
while avoiding the mosh pits and other areas where bodily harm would greet
you.  This crowd is hyped; all kinds of people from all over have come here to
celebrate the diversity of their cousins and brethren of different races.

Desc:$
   A former street kid turned cat shaman, Pita Dewar has been through alot in
her young life. She only recently took the reigns of the ORC, after the last
leader was assassinated by unknown parties or persons. She currently lays on a
pillow on the ground, stroking a scruffy white street cat with one yellow and
one blue eye. After a while she looks up at you and gives you a slight smile.
Her office is mostly bare, and the furniture in it consists mostly of pillow
chairs, cat statues from egypt, and a picture of a young asian ork on the wall
with a black veil over the frame, the picture possibly of a dead lover.

   As you trek up into this area of Cascade Ork, it is obvious you have
wandered into a residential area. To the west lies dozens of homes built into
the rock of this mountainous area. Directly to the northeast lies a parking
garage for any vehicles you might have. Further north you see the mines and
the infamous industry-minded areas of Cascade Ork.

Desc:$
   Cascade Ork living is a strange mix between the typical cave-like dwellings
favored by those of the Ork and Troll races and AmerIndian artwork and
cultural sense. This popular apartment complex has been built into a cliff
face. Leading beneath the complex is a road to the garage for the tenants. It
would probably be in your best interest to lose your ride for the rest of the
trip, as the rest of the terrain leading to other spots in Cascade Ork is much
too rocky for your precious, fragile axles to traverse safely. Just off to the
north of the Apartment complex is a seedy-looking coffin motel where most of
the smugglers who pass through the area stay.

   Quite a few customized smuggling vehicles are parked here, with their
weaponry displayed proudly. A certain trend you've begun to notice is that no
one really gives a hoot and frag over what you do down in Cascade Ork so long
as you don't hurt anybody. People walk around with full armor and weaponry all
over the place without a second glance, and there isn't any true police force
to be seen other than a Stonefist Guard member here and there, who are more
heavily armed than anyone else. In any case it looks as if your ride will be
safe enough stashed down in here, as this special garage for the tenants of
the Apartment block.  A small dwarven guard in a phone booth-shaped security
office dozes on his heavy combat shotgun.

Name:	Under The Bridge
Desc:$
   This cheesy coffin hotel has taken the name "Under The Bridge" in an
attempt at humor, as it is located in a heavily Ork- and Troll-populated area.
A Troll wearing furs and with a battle axe strapped to his back waits to show
you to your room. This motel is cozy, to say the least; most of the clientele
are smugglers that are just stopping here for a few hours. Unfortunately,
since most of the people here are riggers that are used to tight spaces, the
rooms are a tight squeeze for most trolls, as well as most of the coffins
having human-sized furniture. The common place things from Seattle stick out
here, and instead of orkish goats cheese and spiced sausage for breakfast the
nearby restraunt portion of the motel seems to be selling soy burgers, cereal
and other traditionally UCAS foods. Ah well, at least its somewhere that those
with delicate palettes can eat.

   Though chock full of Orks and Trolls waiting on you with fantasy-style

has been built with Humans and Elves in mind. The chairs are comparitively
flimsy, and the food here is all UCAS-style soyburgers and so on. Certainly
not a place to go to to get the real feel of Ork cuisine, but it is suitable
for those who are visiting and may not find the heavily spiced, extremely

   Though the population of those that live in Cascade Ork is small, Orks from
around the area head here to shop, work, and hang out with people of the same
race. There isn't crime to speak of down here; the Stonefist Guard has little
ground to cover and is known for effeciency. That's why there are merely
animal skins seperating each of the large apartments from the hallway you are
currently in. Its also likely there is magical security precautions in place
here; various runic characters are carved into the dark grey, moss covered
stone here and there.

other metal bands can be heard, while to the south, soft chanting and a
gentle, motherlike energy radiates from behind a tattered leather curtain.  A
crudely-fashioned staircase spirals downward, to the underground apartments
the complex.

   As you pass under the large, tattered peice of tanned leather that serves

Southwestern and AmerIndian style, with long blankets hanging on walls with
elegant tribal patterns knit into the fabric, and intricately woven baskets on
almost all open surfaces containing rich grains and herbs for cooking and
spicing up food.  Everything in the room seems to accentuate all senses but
sight; It occurs that the resident within might be blind.

   As you pass through the leather strips that cover the door, you feel the
tingle of some sort of static charge running over your body. After the brief
sensation of shock you look around the wide-open apartment that has been split
into only two rooms, the bathroom, and the huge living room/dining
room/kitchen. A grill has been built into a area to the west of the area with
a ventilation system just above it. Bunk Beds line the west wall and a small,
drek-poor Trid sits in the northwest corner. This large, open apartment looks
like it houses at least seven different people in an ork family, something not
uncommon among the orkish people, whom are known for high amounts of multiple
births.

body stand on end for just a moment. This huge apartment is devoid of
furniture, except for a king-size mattress next to the southern wall that sits
across from a Trid set and simsense deck in the center of the room. With the
wires dangling from above and circuit boards strewn about the area, this room
identifies its occupant as likely being an Otaku Techno-Shaman. In any case,
the Koborokuru with a dozen datajacks dotted along his shaved-bald head is
likely the occupant of this apartment.

   As you step off the wide, rock-carved cobbles that pass for a crude
staircase, you find yourself in the underground hallway of the bottom floor of
the Cascade Ork apartment complex.  Cool in the summer, warm in the winter-
these cave-like apartments offer a little more breathing room and comfort
level for Trolls and Orks tired of living in the human-sized big cities.  The
apartment to the north blasts Troll Rap, and every now and then the sound of
heavy stomping coming from the room above it can be heard, followed by a
reprisal of someone in the room pounding on the roof of the apartment with a
broom.  To the south, the gentle cries of a babies can be heard, accompanied
by the sighs of a mother and the gentle cooing sounds of lullabies.  Down the
hall, however, the steady thump of mining can be heard as the apartments rub
dangerously close to some of the mining operations.

converted into a shop by one entrepreneurial troll.  Posters are taped onto
the roughly-cut stone hews of the walls of this cave, and a sound-system
probably worth more than everything in the building combined blasts perfect
surround-sound rap.  Most of the posters try to conceal egg-cartons that have
been cut up to provide poor man's soundproofing, and obviously this
businesstrog had more than a few complaints from the neighbours about the odd
hours, but he's still making a living selling albums by the all-time greatest
troll rappers, such as Notorious H.U.G.E., Huggy Bear, Fats Trogger, DMT, and
FreeTrog.  Oh, yeah.

   Orks have a high incidence of multiple births. There are some things that
are staggering for even the most jaded, cold souls to see.  This is the
Nursery of the Cascade Ork community, and it is bustling.  This room has been
burrowed deeper into the mountainside than other rooms, and borders on being a
virtual single-story office.  But this is a place of joy, and small children
of almost all races run around this room; clunking into things, crying,
laughing, and giggling.  A few young ork and troll girls who work part-time
jobs here assist the old orkish woman who seems to be the director.  Two truly
massive trolls, in the utmost sense of massive as a word, take care of the
tiniest of the infants who are here, abandoned by their mothers or dropped off
for the day while the women work.  Something seems oddly majestic about seeing
either of the twin trolls cradle one of the absolutely tiny infants in their
gigantic hands.  Nonetheless, you can see several locked cabinets, and some of
the assistants to the director have scars that nobody who has taken care of
children all their lives would.

cries from the Nursery are nearly nullified; the heavy bass of the Trollish
rap music also is swarfed by the overwhelming silence.  As you watch though, a
few spell peices of rock dislodge, and fall to the ground.  Placing ones hand
against the far end of the hallway stone wall, you can feel the gentle
vibrations of the rock, as the mining cutters burrow deeper to the heart of
the Cascade Mountains.

deathly pale looking Hobgoblin runs about the room cleaning things furiously.
Oh yes, chummer, you guessed it, obsessive-compulsive.  Several heaters are in
corners of the room, raising things to abusrdly hot temperatures.  The small
area set aside for a bathroom overfloods with over-the-counter prescription
medicines, and several health magazines rest on almost every available
surface.  Did you wipe your feet at the door?  Who knows what YOU are bringing

   It should say something for how light it is in the room that you just
pulled away the heavy black woollen curtain to get in.  It's absolutely dark,
and the only light that fuctions is a small day-glo plug in near the
kitchenette.  Two massive cots are here, each holding a sleeping troll.  The
trolls look to be quite strong, exceptionally for trolls, and their bodies are
riddled with scars from small cuts.  This must be the shift-apartment for some
of the woodworkers, who often share rooms to save money and allow four people
to split the rent between two shifts.

place is the "Pilot's Bar," as numerous smugglers and T-bird jockeys rarely
make it into town when they do get a break, and they hang out here and swap
stories while waiting for their ships to be re-fueled and certain illicit
cargos to be unloaded.  The building is shaped just like a hangar, the
southeast corner of it burrowing into the side of the same mountain where the
one of the covert landing strips is concealed from the general air
surveillance of the Cascades.  A small door in the northeastern corner opens
up to the ATV trail that leads up to the mountain landing strip.

Name:	The Beginning of Industrial Way
Desc:$
   This is the start of a reasonably well-paved four-lane drive that runs
through the industrial district of Cascade Ork, past the numerous factory
lathes and ore processing plants and metalworking forges that make up the
majority of the Cascade Ork exports.  Welcome to the industrial 'new world,'
chummer.

Name:	Along an ATV Trail
Desc:$
   You're at the start of a well-worn ATV trail that runs up around a mountain
path to the mountain landing strip and down back to the industrial road. The
road is just some rutted dirt about wide enough for a single Ford Bison to
crawl up or down, with no guard rails or any signs that it's anything other
than dirt path on a mountain.  Get ready for a dangerous climb, chummer.

Desc:$
   This is the entrance to mary Magdalene's, the local Greasy Spoon of the
factory worker and mining community.  This small bar and restaurant serves up
some of the best Ork cuisine around, and fights are aplenty between rival Dive
workers or factory grunts.  Open 'til close, year-round, Mary has been here
since it opened, and tends the bar to the east while a few pretty young Ork
girls stagger around giggling while they take orders.

   This is the corner of the bar known as Mary Magdalene's, and table are
crammed in to the gills and just a little beyond.  There are obvious no
maximum occupancy laws for a place this popular.  A few young Orkish girls
dodge between tables and flailing limbs to bring food to people or drinks from
the bar.

Name:	The Juke Box at Mary Magdalene's
Desc:$
   This is the Juke Box at Mary's, and old thing much like what would be used
in one of those retro-diners back in Seattle.  Neon Green and Yellow tubes
line the outside of the thing, and authentic redwood panelling has replaced
most of the original fake plastiwood panelling.  Orks gather around to throw
in coins and single nuyen bills, selecting country songs or classic rock songs
from the 1000-MPs track selection. More than a few fights have erupted here
from playlist choices, but the patronage remains in good spirits as they sing
along with the loud speakers that line the wall here and there.  An aura of
boisterousness permeates everything here, comaradery mingling together with
mild inebriation to result in an atmosphere of almost constant revelry.

Name:	The Stained Glass of Mary Magdalene's
Desc:$
   This is probably one of the greatest things of Mary Magdalene's that few
people comment on any more, but still are magnificent for any newcomer to
behold.  Massive stained glass windows line the wall here, as the edge of the
restaurant rests just over the outcrop of a mountain facing the valley below.
Every few plates a clear section of glass remains, allowing you to look out
over the miles of forest territory dotted with mountains.  Mary keeps the
eatery open until sunrise most days just so patrons can watch the first rays
of light move through the stained glass portraits of Saints and forest scenes,
cold orange light lighting up the specially-made clear densiplast for a few
moments.  This section of the windows overlooks the Southeast crop of the
valley, as miles of pines and mountains look back at you expectantly from the
magnificent veranda.

Name:	The Bar at Mary's
Desc:$
   This is the Bar of Mary Magdalene's, and it is a bustling thing.  Mary
stands behind the counter pouring out drinks at a furious rate, the classic
bartender poise showing off beneath her almost grotesque Troll features.  A
section of the bar is raised slightly for Troll patrons to sit at, another
section shorter for the Dwarves.  The sound of a juke box off in one of the
corners as Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson is played calls your attention over to
some of the small clutches of orks and Trolls sitting around tables singing
along drunkenly to the music over their massive plates of food.
