Name:	Seattle Transit Authority
Desc:$
   This is Seattle's main monorail station. The decor is drab and the lighting
is poor, but at least it's clean. A holo projector sends images onto the
center of the station, images which are perpetually walked through by blase
pedestrians.

   This is a relatively small but beautiful museum. The inside is itself a
work of art, being built entirely without angles; every corner is rounded and
smoothed out. The igloolike structure also helps explain the sense of coldness
that pervades the place -- if art is an expression of the soul, then the soul
is a hollow bowl filled with ice.
