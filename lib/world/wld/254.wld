Name:	Entrance to Crusher 495
Desc:$
   This bar and restaurant was openedly shortly after the infamous Night of
Rage by a group of orks, and has since then become a target to those with
anti-metahuman sentiments, such as Humanis and others. Considering the
appearance of the establishment, it appears that the owners and staff are
quite proud of their accomplishments, as this was one of the first places
around that offered a chance for all races to gather under one roof,
preferably in harmony. Needless to say, the occasional rash of violence from
those who would rather see this place burn to the ground arises every so
often, and is subsequently dealt with.

Name:	Inside a spacious bathroom
Desc:$
   The bathroom, surprisingly, is quite clean and well kept, especially
considering the number of patrons that come and go (literally). The
furnishings and fixtures vary in size and sturdiness, so much so that
regardless if a patron is a dwarf or a hefty troll, none feel out of place and
uncomfortable when using the appliances available. Several stalls are set up
along the far wall, their doors widened to allow for the larger of metatypes,
while a long line of clean sinks with matching mirrors are set above, ranging
from tall to short in order.

Name:	Passing by some dining booths
Desc:$
   A path of what appears to be real wood flooring leads patrons into the main
area of the restaurant, which opens up after a short travel along it. Upon
closer inspection, the 'real wood' is actually textured tiling, which has
tastefully been given a worn grain pattern that allows it to blend in and
offer the establishment an atmosphere of relative grace and depth,
stylistically. Several different sized booths, each of which is comfortably
furnished, are lined along the the sides of the fairly linear pathway,
offering seating for metahumans of any race, size or shape, even the ones with
those snazzy dermal spikes and other things that like to snag and rip normal
furnishings to shreds.

Desc:$
   Tastefully painted synthwood tables are aligned across this span of floor
space, accompanied by a variety of matching chairs as seating for the majority
of the restaurants patrons. An eclectic landscape of various metatypes can be
seen enjoying their meals, shooting the shit, or just enjoying a drink and
keeping their gazes locked to the nearest second-hand trideo screen posted
around the place. A few of the more shady individuals are handling their
business in a discreet manner, since it's generally frowned upon by the owner
and staff that try to keep the crowds content.

   This room has been seperated from the main public area for those discrete
diners and associates who would prefer to steer clear of prying eyes, whether
it's just for their own comfort, or more likely, to handle any business
present at the table. The decorum is much the same as elsewhere in the
establishment, though there are a few small, but certainly welcome changes to
be taken advantage of. First and foremost, the unlabeled black box located
nearby next to the light switch features a small switch of its own,
undoubtedly a white noise generator to keep any eavesdroppers out of luck. The
lighting itself is also able to be changed incrementally, allowing for a much
dimmer atmosphere for those who prefer it that way. A trideo set is posted on
the opposite wall, and there looks to be seating enough for even the largest
of "business" meetings.

Desc:$
   A thin haze of smoke from cigarettes and cigars sits over this corner of
the restaurant, which is obviously designated as a smoking section, as if that
wasn't obvious enough. The general idea that this place has seperate sections
goes to show the bit of effort by the owner to instill at least the basic
forms of manners, even if you're just a go-ganger passing through. As long as
you don't cause trouble, that is, and since those who cause trouble tend to
get 'dealt' with, chances are everyone else will conveniently have been
looking elsewhere, since it doesn't happen if there aren't any witnesses to
it.

   Another section of tables is set up here, but offer a more comfortable
setting, interspaced by plenty of room for foot traffic, mostly due to the
higher number of inebriated patrons. The reason why becomes obvious when
taking a peek down towards the end of the section, where it appears the bar
has set up shop. The number of trideo sets, while not exactly high quality,
has increased, and it appears that one can be seen comfortably regardless of
where you're sitting in the crowd.

Name:	At the bar in Crusher 495
Desc:$
   A thin, barely existent haze of cigarette and cigar smoke fades out around
the far edge of the bar area, most likely due to its proximity to the smoking
sections in back, and also in thanks to the ventilation system that works
overtime keeping the air clean for all these mouth breathers. The synthwood
bar bears the tell tale marks and blemishes of wear and use, since it's been a
few years since the last one was broken by a tussle that got out of control,
as even the most sturdy of furniture tends to break when large metatypes are
in a scuffle. A double set of doors near the back section off the kitchen from
the main rooms, though the occasional whiff of something good trickles out
near the bar.

Desc:$
   The kitchen, as expected from an establishment that serves all the various
metatypes, is furnished with large cooking appliances that tower over and fill
up most of the room inside what would normally be considered a spacious area.
The cooks, which are mostly orks, the occasional troll, and even a dwarf and
human here and there, are all working at a rapid pace to keep up with the rush
of new orders. The smells that linger and mix in the air range as far and wide
as the types of patrons that are in the other rooms, but fortunately the
cooking smells better than all of them. A doorway in the far back of the
kitchen is labeled, "Managers Office: Employees Only."

   This back office is set aside for the manager and employees, although the
latter are much less inclined to enter without a good reason, unless it's time
to collect their paychecks. The office itself is fairly simple, furnished with
a synthwood desk, a few pictures placed upon the walls, a cabinet or two to
hold any paperwork necessary for the daily running of the business. A small
street side window looks out onto the world, which isn't exactly pleasant
considering the condition of some parts of the neighborhood. An old ceiling
fan slowly churns along, squeaking softly as it spins, its beaded chain
swinging faintly from side to side.

   It's almost blatantly obvious the moment you step into this establishment
that you've stumbled into ganger territory, and from a quick precursory glance
around, it doesn't take long to figure out whose turf you're in. Lengths of
barbwire are strewn across the wall and ceilings which are dotted with old
discarded Halloween decorations of all shapes and sizes, ranging from the
casual laughing skeleton skulls to the more macabre jack-o-lanterns with their
faces and toothy maws twisted in abnormal ways.
   Welcome to The Jackal's Lantern. Enjoy your stay, fragface!

   The dress code here is, to say the least, not much of a concern. The
decorum is as expected, and the patrons here aren't much different from the
types visualized upon first entering. Fire hazards seem quite abundant, which
is always a good thing to have in addition to rowdy gangers and lots of highly
flammable booze going around. Empty bottles are tossed carelessly aside along
with other odds and ends, including some of the halloween decorations that
have fallen off the walls and gotten trampled upon. The smell of cigarettes,
cheap hooch, and even cheaper hoochies fills the air. Ahhh... it's just like
home!

   It's a bit odd to describe this as "shady", considering that's exactly what
the rest of this place is, but this part.... even more so. You're not quite
sure what gives you that impression. Maybe it's the half burned halloween
decorations, since apparently that fire hazard issue cropped up sometime in
the past here. Maybe it's the bullet holes in the walls? And not even one or
two of them, it appears someone decided to celebrate new years several times a
night here, much to the dismay of the buildings interior. A lightbulb in the
back, which is the only illumination in the entire section of the hallway,
flickers and dies every so often, only to pop back on when least expected. On
the bright side, you haven't contracted hepatitis... yet.

   When they say hanging at the bar, sometimes they mean it quite literally.
Above what's left of a synthwood bar counter is what appears to be a few
stuffed dummies, dressed up in rival gang colours with instruments such as
kitchen knives politely jammed through their chests. But... you're at least
hoping those are actually dummies, instead of the alternative. While the
gangers that hold this place sacred (IE, puke and pass out on the floor where
ever they please) might get free drinks, it's only polite that newcomers pay
up with cold hard cash for their cheap and watered down booze.

   This seems to be where the gangers keep all of their valuable... ummm....
stuff. Going into detail would be nice, but you're not actually sure what half
of these things are... Is that a half-eaten sandwhich wrapped in an old
newspaper on the shelf? Probably. It's carefully stored next to that dead rat,
which probably had a few bites before keeling over. Good stuff. The rest of
the floor space is taken up by half broken shipping boxes and wooden crates
that were probably hijacked off the back of a truck. The smell is.. You know
what? You don't even want to know. Trust me.

Desc:$
   Frag, when you're done having a seizure from all the strobe lights
flickering at random, maybe then you can take in the scenery, but be sure to
wipe that drool and foam off your chin first. What some would consider a dance
floor, others would probably consider a disaster area. The decorations are
strewn about in an even more haphazard manner, which you're not even sure is
possible, considering the decorum elsewhere here. Orange lighting casts sickly
shadows that grow and shrink with the flickering of the lights, made all the
more chaotic by the flailing masses of some of the more energetic patrons. Or
they could just have their gourds fried by that last batch of BTL's and in
their last spastic death throes. A large stage dominates the western edge of
the floor space, which is where most of the noise seems to be flooding in
from.

Name:	On the stage, party time!
Desc:$
   What was once a wooden stage can still roughly be described as such, if you
look past the obvious faults, like the occasional (ok, so maybe more than
occasional) missing planks of wood that make it a... you know, stage. A mass
of electronic audio equipment is connected haphazardly by a jumble of wires,
some of which are live and begging to electrocute passerbys, or casually short
out and set anything near them ablaze. Two old, ragged turntables seem to be
the center piece of the setup, though you can quite fathom why considering
that vinyl has been dead for a century. The occasional drunken ganger can be
seen attempting to jump off the stage and crowd surf, only to quickly realize
that nobody gives a frag about catching them and faceplants onto the dance
floor with a groan inducing smattering of limbs and synthleather. Two giant
jack-o-lanterns stand astride the stage above, their eyes lighting up at
random with eye burning red strobe lights.

Name:	Passing through the crowd
Desc:$
   The words used to describe most of the patrons that visit this place, let
alone the gangers that run it, probably should never be repeated in polite
company, and that's putting it lightly. The flashing of orange coloured strobe
lights flickers and spills over the inhabitants, casting gangly shadows of
limbs and bodies across the walls and ceilings. Almost every surface is tacked
with old halloween decorations, ranging the gambit from plastic bats to folded
paper skeletons strung up with no real sense of order or decorum. The dance
floor, or what could pass for one, can be seen a ways off north from here,
though you're not sure you can make it without elbowing and shoving a few
people out of your way in the process. Apparently someone has decided to turn
on the fog machine.. either that, or the building has indeed caught on fire,
and everyone is too drunk or high or notice. Either is quite as likely as the
other.

   Your first impression? Leave. Turn around and leave, as fast as you can,
for the love of Kibo, run. Remember that time when you couldn't figure out why
your car wouldn't start, then you spent about half an hour poking around, only
to realize that a devilrat somehow managed to climb into the intake and get
itself wedged in there, and between decomposing and being cooked by the heat
of the engine, you decided to just sell the car instead of attempting to fix
it? Yeah, that's kind of what it smells like, but even worse. The floor is
always wet, always. You pray it's water, but in your heart of hearts, you know
damn well it isn't. Why the frag is EVERYTHING in here sticky?! The funk here
isn't just palpable, it's literal.

bits and pieces of trash are scattered across the floor, and upon the walls
are old film posters, most of which are for action movies involving Michael
Bay'esque levels of explosions, along with old newspaper clippings, all of
which have to do with criminal activities, possibly the gang's own stunts. A
few couches and chairs are set up in a haphazard manner, leaving plenty of
seating for any of the gang who want to kick up their feet and relax.

Desc:$
   Better known around these parts as Banshee, and while some might call it a
nightclub, it seems little more than just an old bar with a relaxed
atmosphere, absent of most of the hustle and bustle common in most similar
places. The decor isn't anything out of the ordinary, and if you didn't know
any better, you'd assume it was just a normal dive: Which is what makes it
fairly popular with its clientele. It's doubtful the patrons will have to deal
with any drunken bar room brawls, or racial bias for that matter, so
everything blows over here pretty smoothly.

   Upon second glance, you come up with much the same impression as the first.
Just your run of the mill dive, complete with all the necessities that make it
worth while: Music, drinks, and a bouncer at the door to keep the riff raff
back out on the streets where they belong. The bar can be seen off towards the
far end of the wide open room, which is taken up by the various tables that
mark its length. The cigarette smoke is only a thin haze hanging near the
ceiling, thanks mostly in part due to the great ventilation system they have
installed for patrons.

   Just what you'd expect from a normal bar, really. A nice and clean,
polished synthwood counter, as well as an amicable looking bartender posted
behind it, ready to serve up drinks you hope aren't watered down. While the
selection here might not be top notch, at least theres a functional tap and
everything is served nice and cold. The wall behind the counter is covered in
a full length mirror, along which are shelves to store some of the more
popular and commonly ordered hooch, with the occasional "good stuff" cropping
up amongst the mix of labels and bottles.

   Quite a number of boothes are set up along the wall, making for a nice
location to kick back and relax, as most patrons are seen doing, most likely
having just gotten off of a long shift at work and looking for some prime
downtime. A nearby ceiling fan is busy pulling the smoke in the air up towards
it and away from those enjoying their drinks and conversations, and while it
may not help cool anyone off, it does a good job of keeping the smoke out of
your eyes. Off towards the corner of the bar can be seen a pool table, along
with a juke box and the occasional pool shark.

   What would a dive be without a pool table pushed into the corner? As
expected, it's not in the best of shape, but at least it's not held together
with duct tape, so it matches perfectly with all the other decor and
furnishings around the establishment. A few framed pictures are hung along the
wall at intervals, some older than others, which hold no real special meaning
aside to the person who hung them from what you can figure after a glance over
each. Most seem to be of the local city landscape, showing how it's changed
over the years, mostly for the worst if you start comparing the older ones to
the newer photos. A token juke box is parked in the corner, complete with some
older tastes in music that most kids and gangers that might be lurking around
confused and feel like they just stumbled into grampa's den.

   This bottleneck of an entrance is used by the bouncers to keep a general
order in the waves of locals and out of towners looking for a night of
entertainment here at The Skeleton. This is helped by the fact that several
lengths of ^rred velvet^N ropes are positioned to hold the lines at bay, as well
as offer the bouncers to pick and choose which of the lucky guests will
actually be getting inside of the club. Quite a few people are turned away,
unless they tip well, or at least look like they do, and while the tougher
looking characters might be able to skate by unharassed, the weapons the
bouncers are lugging around are usually enough to make sure they don't cause
any trouble once inside.

   Club goers have their senses immediately bombarded by the fantasticly loud
and bellowing sound system that is wired into the building, thanks to enough
juice to power a small town and an assortment of speakers tactically
positioned along the walls and ceiling. A thin haze of smoke hangs above head,
through which dances various colours of lights showering across the
establishment mostly from the stage across the expansive room, which glows and
dims in rhythm with the music reverberating through the air and echoing off
every surface to surround patrons in all its glory. A partition of tables and
booths split the room straight ahead, cutting off a direct route to the dance
floor off towards the west of the entrance.

just to be heard over the music that pounds through the establishment. Slits
of multi-coloured light shower through the spaces between bodies and tables in
from the west, causing matching silouettes of the same colour to fan out and
dance across the floors and eastern wall, making for quite the visual
stimulant. This portion of the club appears to consist mostly of those more
interested in enjoying a drink and the company of other club goers instead of
dealing with the frantic pace and enviroment found upon the other side.

Name:	Weaving through the crowd
Desc:$
   Waves of sound and light wash over the crowds of tables and habitues that
frequent the establishment, forming a pulsating wave of sensory overload that
would make even the most dull and deaf come alive and move their bodies to the
rhythm. A constant stream of waitresses toting dishes stacked with assortments
of alcoholic beverages slink in from the east and weave their way through the
crowds before arriving with their stocks at the multitudes of tables and
booths that stretch out across the floor space here.

Name:	Through a stream of habitues
Desc:$
   An almost steady stream of club goers and habitues flow like a strong river
current through this section of the establishment, mostly due to the fact that
it's one of the two main access points that allow people to pass from one
section of the club to the other. This bottleneck might create a nightmare of
logistics for keeping the crowds nice and tidy, but the nightclub scene isn't
for those who aren't already prepared to have to squeeze and elbow their way
through a sea of bodies and limbs to get to where they need to go, which
becomes easier and less of an issue with the more alcohol imbibed.

Name:	In a dark corner of the nightclub
Desc:$
   This far corner of the club has much dimmer lighting, and being the
furthest point away from the music pumping across the spacious room, it's also
the quietest section of the entire place short of one of the private booths.
Here the patrons can actually hear themselves think, as well as one another,
so it makes for a good spot to exchange pleasantries that don't necessarily
need privacy. Speaking of privacy, it appears that there are several private
sections that cater to those who would prefer their business be kept out of
the prying eyes of the public here, whether it be for purposes of simple
pleasure, entertainment or matters of business.

Name:	At The Skeleton's bar
Desc:$
   As expected, this nightclubs bar is full of patrons fully intent of either
getting as drunk as possible, or getting their dates and associates as drunk
as possible. While the crowd might be energetic and rowdy, the security that
sifts through the crowds do a fairly good job of making sure nobody gets too
out of hand, and if they do, they're unceremoniously snatched up and dumped in
the alley out back, usually after a "polite talking to", which is a nice way
of saying they're given an well deserved beating and told to get lost.
Waitresses saddle up to the bar and fill up on their orders before attempting
to make their way back into the fray deeper into the nightclub.

riled up patrons. The shift in atmosphere from the front portion to this
section of the establishment is noticably palpable, and while the former isn't
exactly the most subdued, that only goes to show how much a difference a
change in the volume music and blood alcohol content can make.

   The number of clumped together bodies peters out as the bonds between them
become looser and a sliver of civility and manners returns, along with the
senses of those drawn into the swarm of night clubbers that make up the crowd
upon the dance floor. Various employees and staff members that make their
rounds through the establishment seem to be keeping their distance from the
dance floor itself, for the most part, though occasionally one can be spotted
braving the numbers and delving into it for some reason or another, perhaps to
break up a fight, or to pick up someone who has partied too hard and needs to
be carted off for some fresh air.

   To say this section of the bar is crowded would be an understatement, as it
is nearly engulfed by the edge of the dance floor due to its close proximity.
As expected, the number of intoxicated patrons rises sharply the closer one

it comes to keeping at least a minimal amount of civility and still continue
with business as usual.

   The closer one gets to the stage, the harder time they're likely to have
keeping their balance or senses in the shifting mass of bodies that move and
warp in rhythm to the music as it pounds out of the SOTA sound system and
washes over the dance floor. The music has to be loud, since the noise of
several dozens of party goers would drown it out otherwise. Their combined
presence becomes almost more than the senses of most normal people could
probably handle, but between the booze and the designer drugs practically
dripping from patrons it's easy to tell how they're able to cope with this
onslaught of noise pollution.

multi-coloured lighting is filtered through the limbs and bodies that make up
the undulating mass of dancing patrons, most of whom are content to dance
their nights away, while others seem more interested in catching a glimpse of
the performers on stage, which can be seen from even this far back, though
it's hard to tell with all the frantic flailing of those nearby.

   Madness. Yep, that's a good way to describe it. Almost the floor space
consists of the entire area nearby as what would normally be a very spacious
room is filled with drunken patrons looking for a good time, or those just
looking to get their dance on. A line of plush, quite comfortable looking
booths are set up along the nearby wall, which forms a physical barrier
between those simply enjoying the views, and those wishing to become a part of
them. The foot traffic passing through this section of the club is higher than
usual, probably due to the fact that the bathrooms are located nearby, and the
reasons as to why they would be put to good use seems to go without saying.

Name:	In the bowels of The Skeleton
Desc:$
   A classy name for a classy choice of rooms. The bathroom is about as clean
as can be expected, especially considering the high volume of patrons who put
it to good use. While you may not be eating off of the floor, at least it
seems that the surfaces are regularly cleaned and disinfected, the mirrors
polished and the furnishings kept in fully functional and working condition.
The occasional off colour of paint can be noted, most likely due to the owners
covering up the graffiti that crops up, usually at the tip of a sharpie pen.
While there might be a party going on outside, sometimes there's an even
better party going on in here, especially if you bring your own favours like
the others you occasionally see darting into a vacant stall to partake in.

   Almost, but not all of the sound of the booze fueled fans and the band
going at it on stage nearby is drowned out by the dampening offered by the
nightclubs construction, allowing for those that have gotten lucky enough to
make their way backstage with a less frantic atmosphere and scenery. Throngs
of sound technicians and other roadies are busy taking care of all of the
stuff off-stage, but whose operations are vital for those currently on it
getting their jam on. The furthest sections in the back are where the various
groupies have been stuck for the after party, and if necessary, there also
appears to be a one way emergency exit that leads out onto the street, acting
as a discrete side exit for some of the more popular bands that have been
known to frequent the place on occasion.

Desc:$
   As expected from a stage in one of the hottest nightclubs in the area,
things are absolutely hectic and the atmosphere is dramatically tuned into
what can only be described as madness incarnate, fortunately it's accompanied
by some sweet fragging music. The staff seems to be doing a fairly good job of
keeping anyone from jumping or crawling their way up onto the stage, most of
which are "politely" escorted back off of it, while some of the more driven
fans and clubbers are simply hurled back into the swarm from whence they came.
The stage itself is strewn with the setups and particular instruments
necessary to pull off a successful gig, and along with the establishments
sound system, the stage features its own multitudes of speakers, which tower
around in the background and create a open ended cage of noise to assault the
senses of those nearest to the performers.

comfort in these private back rooms. Well furnished with high quality
materials, granted most of them are synthetic, but as long as they look good
that's all that matters. A booth against the far wall consists of a
semi-circular arrangement of seats around a sturdy table, upon which is
embedded into its surface an array of devices that should be enough to keep
most patrons busy and amused. Small trideo screens, telecom hook-ups and even
a conveniently placed and tastefully concealed white noise generator is
offered to keep any private conversations within the room.

Name:	A poorly lit alley by The Skeleton
Desc:$
   This gritty alley features poor drainage, as indicated by the almost
constant shallow puddle running right down its center, spilling down the sides
of the buildings and leaving behind visible residue marks. An old piece of
fencing stands stride the mouth of the alley, and both sides of the uneven
path are stacked haphazardly with broken shipping pallets and half filled
black trash bags, overturned garbage cans and rusty green dumpsters. A sturdy
emergency exit is posted at the far end, which features no handle and seems
only capable of being opened from the inside, keeping anyone attempting to
sneak in The Skeleton nightclub out of luck. The sounds of music can be heard
pounding out through the walls as testament of how much partying is going on
inside of the building.

Desc:$
   When strolling into The Downfall, one is met with an atmosphere not
entirely common amongst Touristville or the Barrens itself. First and
foremost, the atmosphere is laid back and easy going, and it lacks the smells
and sounds that are regularly associated with the area, namely the lack of
fist fights, gunshots and garbage.

Name:	Perusing the bar
Desc:$
   The first thing you might notice is that this place actually has clean air,
which is a welcome change of pace from the neighborhood outside. The soft hum
of ventilation overheard is likely the culprit behind that detail, handling
any of the cigar and cigarette smoke the patrons might be pumping out. Off to
one end of the establishment sits a cozy little bar, while towards the back
there are a few tables and booths to take advantage of if any of the
habituates want to stay out of sight during their stay. The reason why things
are so laid back may have something to do with the fact this joint is popular
amongst mages and other awakened, starting trouble isn't a good idea for
anyone involved lest things get out of hand, fast.

   Laid back is the name of the game here, which is easy to do with the array
of comfortable looking stools lining along the front of the bar. The
appearance of the bar itself is a throw back to the old days, nothing fancy to
be had, just good old fashioned choice liquor, a trideo set and the company of
other bar flies to keep ones attention occupied. A full length mirror lines
the wall behind the counter, allowing those seated at it a clear view of the
going ons of the establishment, just in case.

Name:	The Downfall, back corner of the bar
Desc:$
   Sparsely furnished with only a few tables and chairs, but there is a bit of
standing room in front of the small stage set up for some of the musical acts
that are occasionally booked to play. A small dedicated sound system and other
electronics are well kept, but don't appear to get a great deal of use since
the locals are mostly content to keep themselves entertained with the nearby
jukebox. There are a few dartboards lining the walls, as well as a small
chessboard table set up for those patrons that enjoy a game or two over a
drink. An off-coloured wood panel stands out from its neighboring panels along
the eastern wall, which features a cryptic mystical symbol carved in its face.

   There are a few tables and chairs set up around this end of the bar, but
the main attraction is clearly the modernized jukebox bolted to the far wall.
All sorts of oldschool music can be found churning out of it, and it's safe to
say that most of the time you'll have to wait your turn since there are
already several songs input already by previous patrons.

   This back room would be spacious, if it weren't for the fact that every
wall and square inch of real estate is covered in shelves and stacks of books
and other occult materials. Most of it is in dire need of a dusting, while
others are brand new and heavily polished to a shine. There are no windows, so
the only light source comes by way of a single dim, bare lightbulb hanging
from the ceiling, along with a few wax candles that dot the landscape here and
there. The sounds of rummaging can be heard from the far corner, which comes
from the old wizened dwarf that's mostly concealed by a stack of hastily
organized books and tomes.

clinic in the back of a seedy alley. The tile floor is mismatched from
previous patch jobs, their surfaces scuffed and cracked here and there across
the expanse of multi-coloured tiles. The walls are done in cheap synthwood
paneling, but at least they had the decency to spring for the kind that has
faux wood grain to try and sell the look. A few old coffee tables are spaced
out along the length of the room, along with different types of chairs, some
of which have seen better days. Stacks of magazines are piled up haphazardly
upon the tables for reading material while customers wait, ranging from
women's magazines to motor vehicle booklets, and even the occasional porno mag
slipped in for good measure.

consists of plastering posters and hanging up picture frames over them in the
hopes that nobody will notice. A shop of sorts is set up here, or at least the
premise of one, with the intent to sell various medical supplies that are no
longer needed.

   Cheap carpeting runs the length of this fairly wide hallway, most of which
has seen some sort of abuse over its lifetime, frayed bits and pieces of
twisted thread coming unraveled from constant foot traffic. Dingy inset
lighting cast a slightly yellow glow to illuminate the hallway, the plaster
covered drywall doing little to make the scenery any less dull and
unappealing. The occasional low edge table showcases the finest in design by
way of plastic plants attempting to breathe a little life into the place. A
plastic placard is nailed into the wall beside each of the two doors that exit
out of the corridor.

wasn't a great idea to get your hopes up much to begin with. Medical
instruments are sorted in jars and cabinets and a plastic covered cots are
tucked against the walls, leaving little room for the single operating table
in the corner. Two sets of doors leave into adjoining rooms, though one of

not, they're definitely up to date and expensive. There's a rather stark
difference between this office and the others, most likely due to the
practitioner on duty, who won't settle for anything but the best. A single
surgical table is flanked by a comfortable looking medical bed, complete with
IV's and other equipment to keep patients alive as best as possible. A small
plastic ^RSIGN^N has been set up here off to the side.

   The parking lot consists of mostly a partially paved chunk of land

little more than hastily filled gravel patches. There's enough parking space
for plenty of vehicles, though a little maneuvering may be necessary due to
the haphazard placement of lamp posts, overlapping parking space lines and
occasional cement log dotting the landscape. A large vinyl sign has a bit of
graffiti on it, but it does little to cover up the large block letters that
spell the restaurant's name: "^yYumago Yangnom Korean BBQ^N".

Desc:$
   While it may not be five-star in appearances, the smell coming in from the
kitchen says otherwise, as long as you don't mind it sticking to your clothes
for a week. Just one of the hazards of coming to a Korean BBQ joint, but on
the bright side, the food is delicious. A few casually dressed hostesses seem
to suit the laid back, less than stellar appearance of the establishment, so
they don't look out of place in the slightest. A few small rooms are located
off of the main lobby, which showcases a few long fish tanks with various
seafood, some of which are simply for decoration, while others are just
waiting it out for their turn to appear on a plate.

   Several tables are set up around the room in a manner to optimize the

Name:	A fast paced Korean kitchen
Desc:$
   What awaits anyone foolish enough to enter the kitchen is a labyrinth of
grills, portable ovens, gridirons, griddles and a few short Korean chefs that
speak a million miles a second, which is plenty enough to make most of the
senses begin to spin. The smells of marinated and grilled meat permeate not
only the air, but everything else that it makes contact with, so if you prefer
that your clothes don't smell like it for a week it's best not to step foot in
here. Towards the rear of the kitchen is a flimsy wooden door with a plastic
placard labeled: Manager's Office.

   The furniture consists mostly of empty plastic drink boxes stacked up
against one end of the office. The other wall is covered in corkboard, stuck
upon which with thumb tacks (and the occasional knife) are various bits of
paperwork, all of which is in Korean. Good luck actually reading any of it,
since the hand writing itself is nearly illegible, so being fluent in the
language doesn't help as much as one would think. An old wooden topped cabinet
styled desk is pushed against the far back behind the rest of the clutter, the
surface of which is taken up by multiple ashtrays, most filled to the brim,
and even a few with still lit cigarettes left in them.

   Congratulations, you've made it to the top of the antenna. What was the
point of this again..? Climbing back down is going to prove to be just as
dangerous and unsafe as having gotten up here in the first place, so there
isn't too much to celebrate. The namesake of the type of antenna becomes
clear, since when you're gazing down at the roof top below the antenna has the
appearance of a turnstile with its prongs arranged and sticking out at ninety
degree angles from one another.

   There isn't too much further up to go to reach the top, but considering the
difficulty with shimmying up and around the structure without the help of any
actual hold or foot holds makes for quite an exciting time. A few old bird
nests have been abandoned and left behind, while others look to have been put
together somewhat recently, but considering they've decided to build them on
the ledges you're using to grab and step onto, it probably doesn't make for
the safest of climbs.

   All sorts of filth are caked onto the surface of the steel, consisting of
old bird droppings and residue left behind from the occasional bout of acid
rain. Patches of the material are showing rust, but it doesn't appear to have
compromised its structure, at least not much. The service ladder rungs
disappear from sight just a few meters above the roof top, their bolts having
rusted and given way. Climbing the structure seems like a daunting task, even
moreso than the first part of the venture. It still isn't too late to turn
back and hop down, chummer.

   The side of the roof top is covered in old debris, ranging from rusted
ventilation caps to old television antenna and busted satellite dishes. The
dominating feature here is clearly the old turnstile antenna that looms
overhead, quite possibly the only utility in (or on) this building that is
still mostly in one piece. That isn't to say that the weather has been kind to
it, but the building itself is likely to fall apart before it does. The
service ladder rungs bolted to the side, however, mostly appear to be missing.

it weren't for the fact that the floor here is practically nonexistent. Aside
from a little rotten wooden planks sticking out haphazardly along the edges of
the shaft, there isn't much in the way of places to stand, so it would be best
for all involved to move carefully. An old service door stands off to the
western side of what's left of the room, while a mangled pair of outer
elevator doors stands permanently ajar along the east wall, which by the flow
of air coming into the room seems to be outside the building.

roof itself has quite a few holes worn into it, while other patches of
concrete are cracked and look like they're threatening to cave in if stepped
upon. There isn't much in the way of a skyline, as taller buildings surround
this perch, cutting off any real view of the rest of Touristville. Considering
the appearance of the place in general, that probably isn't a bad thing
either.

   The hand and foot holds are less and less reliable the further up you
attempt to climb, the service elevator having rusted and crumbled away so
large gaps in them are more frequent. While it's possible to continue upwards,
it's likely to get even harder. There is still practically no light, leaving
the space cold and dark, and slightly anxiety inducing in atmosphere. There is
a set of outer elevator doors along the eastern wall that can be reached with
a little maneuvering.

   Seeing as there's no electricity running to this part of the building, the
shaft is eerily dark, making it rather difficult to see what is further up
along it. The cables running up to the top of the shaft swing loosely, and
while one could use them to climb up, it may prove troublesome as some of the
cable has rusted and frayed. There is also a service ladder, but unfortunately
it's in even worse shape than the cable, and it appears that almost all of the
rungs have rusted to little more than nubs. A set of outer elevator doors can
be found a meter or so above the top of the elevator you're standing on.

Name:	A fenced in parking lot
Desc:$
   Chainlink fencing runs the length around this paved lot, an occasional
electric warning sign hanging on it to disuade some of the less than desirable
residents around here from ransacking the vehicles during the night time
hours. Several broken down vehicles sit stride working models, awaiting a
repair or fix, but most of the actual parking spaces appear to be used up by
employees. A large vinyl sign reading ^W"^YCabbie Connection^W"^N is posted atop an
overhang on the warehouse style building with several sets of vertical garage
doors.

Name:	In a garage smelling of grease
Desc:$
   Several vertical garage doors open up this already spacious converted
warehouse, inside of which are a slew of numerous types of vehicles, although
most of them are old taxi cabs. Some of the cabs are in bad shape, their hoods
propped open and gutted of parts, some slated for stripping for spare parts
while others are awaiting a donor so they can get back into action. Snaking
stains of centuries old oil and grease spread from the dismantling areas and
beneath the small pneumatic lifts, leaving the entire area smelling heavily of
it despite the ventilation.

have in stock and aren't doing them any good.

partition of clear plastic, offering the person behind it a bit of privacy
when using the dispatch radio set up there as well.

Desc:$
   While it was originally paved, there's very little of it left that hasn't
been reduced to gravel and rocks by now, thanks mostly to the rough treatment
of vehicles combined with the weeds and grasses that sprout up from cracks to
further its degradation. There is plenty of parking spaces, though there is
little in the way of painted lines or designated spots, and instead everyone
seems to be parking where they damn well please. Further past the parking area
there seems to be a flea market of sorts set up outside this side of the main
mall building.

   The sweet and fragrant scent of sugary goodness wafts through the air on
this end of the flea market path, and the peddlers aren't shy about convincing
would-be customers from trying a piece or two in a blatant attempt to solicit
them into buying more. A wide assortment of confections are put up for sale
here, and the competition is a little fierce between booths, so not just
whoever has the best product sells the most, they've got to offer low prices
as well.

   Table after table have trinkets and other pieces of jewelry put up for
perusal, with some of the cheaper pieces put out front while the more
expensive pieces can be found behind display cases or behind counters, just in
case anyone decides they want to walk off with any merchandise. There doesn't
seem to be much security here in the flea market, but that isn't to say it's
at Z-zone levels. In fact, since all of the peddlers are in the same boat,
theft is frowned heavily upon by all of the vendors, who are just as likely to
turn into a mob and lynch any thieves, regardless of whether or not they're
the ones who were stolen from in the first place. Feel free to press your
luck, chummer.

   The sounds and smells of the flea market are heard all around regardless of
whether it's day or night, there's never an hour where hawking possibly
illicit, bootleg or outright illegal goods isn't a good idea. There's always a
buyer for everything, after all. Makeshift tables, kiosks and canvas roofed
booths dot the landscape, setting up shop where ever they can find a place to
do so. It's doubtful most of these places have licenses for what they're
selling, but since when did that ever matter? Several tables nearby the main
pathway, which is little more than a dirt path, has a wide assortment of
clothing and apparel spread out across them for display.

   The strong aroma of cooked and aged meats permeates the air along this side
path of the flea market, which is sure to draw in plenty of customers, even if
they may have filler that is a little beneath the FDA guidelines for safe
consumption. After standing around for a while and being bombarded by the
smells, it's easy to see why most people would be willing to overlook such a
trivial detail, all that matters is if it tastes good. One of the tents here
has a wide assortment of processed meats hanging in front of the stall, put up
on display to help draw in anyone thinking twice of simply walking by.

   This edge of the flea market is also bathed in the sweet smell of home
cooked food, which is coupled with the slightly less delicious but no less
tasty scents of fast food level products and grease. Peddlers of all races,
size, shape and colour put up their wares for passerbys to visually partake
in, along with a few stands that are offering free samples to further convince
them of their expected patronage. One of the more popular booths seems to be
the makeshift shack tucked into the corner that's serving up a combination of
chicken and waffles.

   Actual pavement sprouts up from the ground, along with an actual building
to go along with it, which stands in stark contrast to the dirt mall clinging
to the side of it. Some times having a roof over your shop has its benefits,
as does plumbing and running electricity. Store fronts showcase the wares
they're peddling, sometimes in a more literal manner, though there seems to be
a fair bit of goods to pick and choose from.

   The mall isn't exactly what you'd call extravagant, and from the looks of
things, it appears to simply be a remodeled stripmall that originally have a
street running down its center. The original foundations of the tightly packed
buildings are still visible, but the road has been repaved into a wide walkway
and the entire thing has been roofed in to give it some semblance of civility.
Various shops line each side of the walkway itself and there are several
kiosks, cement planters and benches dotting the landscape in each direction.

   One glance around is all you need to realize this is a martial arts shop,
they tend to all be exactly the same, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. For
example? Weapons! While some of them may not have the sturdiest of
constructions, or the sharpest of edges, a few are as close to the real deal
as you're likely to get. Forget about paper trails, these babies were probably
lifted in the first place. Frag, they likely don't even card customers either,
kids can easily come in and spend their parents money.

atmosphere, while a wide, paved walkway leads further east into the heart of

   Like its namesake suggests, there's definitely plenty of junk laying around
and stacked up inside of bins that are lining the aisles and walls. They don't
deal entirely in junk, just mostly, and in fact they're more akin to a pawn
shop, as long as it's something they can turn a profit on, whether it be scrap
material or most other things, they'll probably buy it. As long as the price
is right, of course.

Name:	Redmond Wholesale Furniture
Desc:$
   Just as the name of the shop suggests, it deals mostly in wholesale and
after market furniture and replacements. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like
any of it is extremely high quality, but there are a few pieces worth taking a
closer look at. Multiple displays are put up around the spacious shop,
showcasing the different styles and sets available, along with lines of single
piece furniture, containers and other storage bins that double as makeshift
furnishings to use up space efficiently.

Name:	Along the mall walkway
Desc:$
   The walkway itself, while having been repaved recently, has settled just a
little unevenly, making some of the planters and benches look a bit crooked.
One patch has been cordoned off by plastic yellow 'wet floor' signs in attempt
to keep some of the foot traffic away from some of the more dubious lengths of
this poor workmanship. Various shops line each side of the walkway, though
some of the foot traffic has to be redirected a little to let customers flow
in and out freely.

Desc:$
   What stands before customers is an expansive system of shelves and bins
that decorate the store aisles and walls, its appearance is similar to that of
a music store or a library, the latter being more accurate considering the
information stored in these chips. If you're looking for wholesale
activesofts, you've definitely come to the right place, they're more than
likely to have at least one of them you're interested in. A portion of the
wall has been knocked out on the east side, which has allowed the shop to
expand into the adjoining building.

   Surgery seems to be the name of the game here, and it comes with a fancy
price tag if those listed are to be believed. The set up seems fairly up to
par, as far as surviving the ordeal goes, and frankly, you've probably gotten
surgery in much more sketchy enviroments than this one. Things are kept
sterile and clean, even outside of the back room dedicated for surgery and
recovery.

Name:	Eastern entrance of the strip mall
Desc:$
   An old collection of buildings lines each side of what used to be a pair of
strip malls facing one another from across a wide street that run down the
middle of them, but it has long since been remodeled so appear like an actual
indoor mall. The attempt is furthered by the repaved street, which now acts as
a walkway to allow for foot traffic, the occasional planter and bench
combination has been set up along its center to help reinforce this
appearance.

   An array of showcases and interactive displays allow customers to peruse
the assortment of eye replacements and cosmetic modifications available for
purchase. The shop is kept nice and tidy for to cater to the discerning
shopper on the prowl for new peepers. A private surgery theatre and recovery
clinic has been set up in the rear of the building, since some of the
procedures may require bed rest ranging from an hour or two or even longer
depending on any complications, even if they are unlikely.

Name:	Parking lot of Redmond Way Mall
Desc:$
   This lot has been clearly set aside for vehicle parking, whether it be
employee or customers, there's plenty of room to spare. An occasional weed
sprouts up from between the many cracks spreading through the cement,
indicating that it has been at least a decade or two so since it was last
paved, as do the occasional patches of black top used to fill in the larger
cracks and pot holes that have accumulated in the meanwhile. A remodeled strip
mall of sorts can be seen off to the west, attempting its best at looking like
it isn't abandoned or run down.
