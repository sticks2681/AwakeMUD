Name:	Foyer of the Seattle Opera House
Desc:$
   A marvelous glass facade lines the entrance to the Opera House. From
well-dressed corporate yuppies to intimidating beneficiaries of organized
crime, the Opera House draws in a rather large crowd of wealthy patrons. A
rather pompous host with a charismatic presence and strong, projecting voice
greets the clientele, offering them the choice tickets and occasionally
gesturing in the distance to young, quiet attendants that collect coats and
other belongings from more esteemed guests for storage during the show.

Name:	Seattle Opera House
Desc:$
   The marvelous glass facade before you is the Seattle Opera House. One of
the centers for the cultural elite and just plain rich, the house puts on the
majority of Seattle's finest orchestral and fine musical arts performances.
The massive gilded main doors stand open inviting you in as valets motion the
many luxury cars to an undergound parking garage.

Name:	An Elegant Hall
Desc:$
   The modernist facade of the entrance starts to blend mildly with the
classical style of the old building as marble pillars support the distant
stairs to the balcony. The main hall divides into three main paths, the first
into the house seating, straight to the north and then the paths to the
northeast and the northwest, leading to balcony seating, as well as to a piano
bar to the northwest and a cafe to the northeast.

   This bathroom is absurdly clean, almost to the point of a hospital. One
could half expect it to smell of antiseptic upon entering. A number of urinals
line the wall, leading to a handful of stalls. All of the facets are identical
and made out of titanium, save for one that has a small bronze plaque on it.
Upon closer inspection of the toilet seat, the plaque reads: "This toilet seat
donated by Ryan Aris and brought to you courtesy of Kyzrath Noshilim." The
titanium seems to be less uniform than the others, as though it had been
melted down from separate items and molded together haphazardly.

years of standing around listening to people drunkenly tell him their life

ancient catacombs, likely from the base of the old Spanish church that had
been there hundreds of years ago. The blue glow seems to come from the west,
where the air seems to be more moist, and a corridor has been hollowed out to
the north.

Name:	A small cavern, converted into living space
Desc:$
   A rock cavern glitters with an iridescent turquoise light, emanating from a
spring emerging from an iron grate near the wall. A rather large dais is to
the north, supporting a rather large canopy bed, shrouded in white Egyptian
cotton. This area itself seems rather bare, save for the floor, which is
covered with a number of ancient Persian rugs and rich white shag carpet, at
least until the edge of the spring, where it cuts off and is replaced by dark
onyx stone tiling, covering the slick stone floor. As your eyes drift closer
to the north, two smaller daises emerge from the ground, overlapping slightly
before merging into the larger dais the bed rests on. To the left, a large
armoire of antique rosewood stands. To the right, a dominating organ stands,
tuned lowly to emit haunting notes that echo through the cavern, and even,
occasionally, up into the Opera House.

   An enormous round marble table with a crimson Maltese cross designed over
it forms the center of this room, hidden in shadow. A single ray of light
somehow creeps from the ceiling, bursting upon the center of the table and
making the shape of the Maltese cross the only completely distinguishable
thing in the room. The seats around the table are hidden in shadow, and
despite the ancient appearance and archaic style of the room, the drone of
white noise generators around the room make it clear that the room has been
outfitted with the most modern equipment to prevent electronic eavesdropping.
The table has a small imprint at each seat, about the appropriate size to fit
a chess piece... which one may assume is used to represent the speakers hidden
in the shadows.

   This room is made up of a large cavern with walls done best to be carved
straight on three sides. The area is dimly lit with a large amount of white
candles set up sporadically on furniture or on holders pinned against the
walls. Against the farthest wall there is a large king-sized bed with four
large ^yoak^n posts at each corner and ^Lblack^N silken sheets laid over it. On one
wall is a large mural expressing both the dark and light images expressing the
duality of man, while the other walls are dark and earthy. Against the
adjoining wall, a gunsafe sits here along with a wide array of discarded ammo,
weapons and armor strewn against the wall along with a bookshelf. A large soft
Venetian rug covers most of the floor of the living area with a dark ^bblue^N
color and dark ^wcream^N designs. The floor extends to the right smoothly sloping
gently down to a small hot spring of dark ^bwater^N letting off steam into a vent
in the ceiling of the cave.

Name:	A dank, dark cell
Desc:$
   Basically nothing more than a pit dig into the bedrock, with a small drain
in the center of the slightly concave floor to dispose of unpleasant fluids.
Scratches mar the walls in some places, some possibly trying to spell out some
message, but what message that is cannot be determined. The pungent stench of
mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls. It's pitch black, you're likely to
be eaten by a grue.

Name:	Atop a large dais
Desc:$
   A large dais emerges from the two shorter daises over the otherwise level
floor. The dais seems to be a rather subtle way of self-aggrandizement, as it
features the primary living area of the owner: his bed. The walls narrow,
turning this room into a bubble between the entrance and a small stone
corridor heading to the north. This room is blatantly ostentatious, and
arrogant, in many regards. More expensive and luxuriant Persian rugs than
before surround the bedding, reaching the stone walls which are no longer bare
stone, but covered in large mirrors, reflecting the subtle light of the spring
throughout the area.

Desc:$
   The hot spring water has pooled here, bubbling effervescently with the
heat, derived from some underground thermal dynamic that remains invisible to
the eye. The stone surrounding the spring has been refurnished with black onyx
tile, causing the dazzling sapphire light of the water to turn to murky
darkness at the edges, and to burst forth in a beautiful display over the
ceiling.

Name:	A Crowded Library
Desc:$
   If anything, this room is even more crowded with arcane texts and strange
devices than the one that came before it, despite being almost twice the size.
Shelves are carved directly into the living stone of the walls, packed with
all manner of books and scrolls, skulls of strange animals and jars of
unidentifiable substances. Antique mahogany bookshelves and haphazard stacks
of books creates a maze of narrow passages through the center of the room. A
battered oaken table sits in one corner, littered with bottles and beakers and
other alchemical equipment of unknown purpose. At the far end of the room a
large area has been cleared of books and a summoning circle has been carefully
etched on the stone floor.

   A sparkling turquoise pool has formed, apparently a spring from an
underground river, glowing a beautiful light blue with nutrients soaked likely
from the stone walls. Blue crystals have formed along the walls, catching and
reflecting the light from the water and the scant lamps, making the grotto a
dazzlingly beautiful place. The rock around the small pool has been smoothed,
turning it essentially into a small Jacuzzi, as the water steams from the
nearby underground hot spring.

   Rising from the roof of the opera house, a delicate glass dome shields a
beautiful garden from both the harsh elements of the north-west as well as the
smog and pollution of the city. Winding, rock-lined paths lead through the
collection of carefully tended and aesthetically pleasing plant-life,
eventually making their way across a small trickling stream and to the koi
pond positioned under the very center of the dome. Small flowering trees,
dogwood and cherry and peony, are scattered throughout the garden, providing
shade on the rare sunny days and filling the dome with the sweet scent of
their blossoms. A peaceful feeling of calm serenity pervades the area.
