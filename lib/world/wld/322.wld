Desc:$
   The street halts between the worn buildings to a dead end. It is too dirty,
there are sheets of paper flying around, carried by the soft wind. Pieces of
glass from the buildings' broken windows decorate some corners of the street.
Some of the streetlights are broken as well, but the few who survived the
street gangs still illuminate the ambient, even if sparsely.

   Sebastiao street was one of the first streets stablished over these parts.
It is rather dirty, with trash thrown in the building corners. A few
streetlights illuminate the ambient by night, while others were broken by
local gangs. Few cars run through these streets, for they are known to be
hangout of violent gangs.

   This is the crossing between the two streets. Even though dirty and unkept,
the place is well sinalized, and a semaphore controls the driving flux through
the intersection. There are cars waiting for the semaphore to open, while the

Pedestrians cross the street whenever the semaphore stop the cars. Some

poorly patrooled by the local police. That has caused accelerated growth of
the local gangs, whoose members are often seen in the local bars, either

   Joana street runs across the amazonian capital in the north-south
direction. It is dirty, with many streetlights broken or in malfunction. The
view is most basically composed of buildings and a few shops. Some citizens
can be seen walking around, either going to or coming back from work. A few
cars drive by. This street, just as the others in the capital, are not very
patrolled by the local police.

   This is the crossing between the two streets. Even though dirty and unkept,
the place is well sinalized, and a semaphore controls the driving flux through
the intersection. There are cars waiting for the semaphore to open, while the
others drive by, either continuing forward or turning to the other street.
Pedestrians cross the street whenever the semaphore stop the cars. Some
malfunctioning streetlights illuminate the ambient.

usually sits by the counter on a corner of the room, waiting to serve the few
customers. Spread over the room are glass stands containing the military ware.

#32252
Name:	The Amazonia Ferry
Desc:$
   A thin stretch of tarpaulin stretched between four rickety poles lends a
blue tint to a collection of rotting wood beams and rusty railings, held
together by little more then a few lengths of rope and the occasional nail and
far from waterproof. A large, noisy outboard motor to one end of the makeshift
barge leaks oil onto the timbers as it revs unevenly, spewing blue smoke out
across the water.
