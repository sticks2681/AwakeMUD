candles around you flicker wildly.

   As you walk in you look around to see a rather large room. The walls still
Obsidian, but the floors here have changed to wood, dark crimson in color
though. The walls are adorned yet still with the black-flamed candles.
Tapestries line some parts of the walls. While Artifact weapons and armor from
all times cover other parts. You see a large table sitting towards the center
of this room surrounded by many leather chairs. A fireplace spans the length
of one wall burning brightly with the black flames you have grown used to
seeing in this place.

   You step up into this room and you are in awe at its size and beauty. There
is a very large canopy bed in the center of this room. Off the top and four
posts hangs crimson red silk curtains. Closed at the moment you see nothing
else. Looking around you see a balcony to the North and a door to the South. A
large rug lays at the foot of the bed, looks like some type of fur. But it
really can't be told until you step closer to it. Another large fireplace is
inset inside a wall as the candles in here are like the others. Black in
flames with white tips. It is rather warm in here. After a few minutes you
feel a couple drops of sweat roll down your forehead.

   You step off the stairs to look around this room. Standing in the center
its dark in here. The only light that is given off is from the other rooms
that seem to be surrounding this one. The ground made of uneven stone. Almost
like any dungeon would. The air cold and dank. You shiver as you stand here a
few minutes

   As you step into this room you have to take a double take of the items
within the confines of the stone walls. Like the Armory there are weapons here
of every kind. Swords thousands of years old to the latest technology.
Anything your heart could want is at your finger tips.

   This room is the largest of the others down here. Greater than the size of
a football field in itself. Hundreds of candles lit this room only to show
thousands apon thousands of books. Magical in being, Stories, Journals. A Mage
could spend their whole life down here and never read the same book twice.
Items, oh what items you can get your hands on. The power felt inside this
room is almost overwhelming to one's soul. You see a large table of to one
side. It's surface is cluttered with books, parchment's and vials containing
strange liquids. Someone is trying to get ready for some type of casting. I
wonder what it could be.

Two large couches are sitting in here. Big enough to hold anything for the
amount of company this house see's. Against the other wall a large Trid is
placed with every possible playtoy one could imagine for entertainment. The
soundsystem can be heard in every room from this one. In front of the couches
sits a large coffee table. Be careful its made of glass, dont need anyone
putting their feet throught it. And to the side of the couches sits a Lazy
Boy...Oh gods it looks comfy.
