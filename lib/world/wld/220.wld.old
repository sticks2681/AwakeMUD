Name:	East Powell and Roberts
Desc:$
   You stand at the intersection of Powell Boulevard and Southeast Roberts
Avenue. Large, abandoned buildings of all sizes line the streets in every
direction. To the west, you can make out the Community Park, and the bleak
remains of Western Powell.

Desc:$
   Powell continues along the northern border of Gresham. A rancid smelling
steam wafts through a sewer grate in the middle of the road, making your nose
twitch. A few cheap looking apartment blocks line the northern side of the
street, with a band of street kids congregated on the stoop of one, laughing
and swearing. To your south, there's a fork in the road.

   East Powell continues southeast to meet up with Highway 26. To your north,
a set of payphones, covered in gang scrawl, is dimly lit in front of a
newsagent. A couple of trees planted on the sidewalk struggle to survive, and
a pedestrian crossing leads across the street to a dingy looking bar. While
rather shabby looking, this area is beautiful compared to the horrors of
Gresham, to the east. The odd car passes by, never eager to stick around long.

   From up here, you can see the bleak remains of what used to be Gresham. You
can also see the entire camp. It's crawling with crimson and white foot
soldiers, and some nasty looking vehicles.. with legs. The handrails are
covered in barbed wire, and the roof is made of flat tin.

it, for there are skyscrapers and shadowrunners, integration, and the
influence of megacorps. But while Downtown is an overwhelming chemistry
experiment of race and culture, Tacoma is unified. There are many historical
sites which keep the Night of Rage alive, as well as holidays set aside for
certainly the most respectable. To the north, a set of stairs leads up to a
bar.
