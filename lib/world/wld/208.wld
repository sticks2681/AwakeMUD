Desc:$
   You stand on the Burnside Bridge.  Trash clutters the area, and not far
west you can see an intersection, and a simple staircase leads down.

Desc:$
   This is one of the worst areas of Burnside.  There is a bridge to the east,
taking you into east Portland, and west through downtown.  The area is adorned
with burnt chips, filth, and graffiti.  Along the walls you notice a few
Burnside Cadillacs.

   This intersection looks fairly seedy, with discarded fast food wrappers,
broken beer bottles and spent BTL chips littering both the street and
sidewalk. The boarded-over entrance to a closed club is to the southeast.

   The eastmost street leading into Portland's Chinatown is here.  The
lighting is bad, and the smell of asian cooking is strong, and the general
sense of danger is strong.  It is well known that the Chinatown area is not
too kind, especially in the days of Elven rulership, where Chinatown's human
enclave has been relegated to ghetto status.

   A dark portion of the street, where the trees have overgrown and blocked
much of the light coming from the skyscrapers above you on the south side of
Burnside.  It would be a good idea to take a fast note of this area, as this
could be a good place for a bolt hole.  A slight breeze picks up and makes a
gentle howl as the air passes the shattered glass of the once prestigeous bar
here on the corner.

   A long series of defunct cars, and trucks is piled high here, and tears
into the road.  Looks like the big one hit real hard.  Life here has obviously
never went on like normal, as a matter of fact it appears to have regressed.
You can see a group of runners sitting outside of a small nightclub, lingering
between runs.  Perchance, chummer, this might be a good place to look for
work.

   The mid street of Portland, dividing North and South stretches out before
you.  To the east you can barely make out the bridge over the Willamette
River.  Mid-block on the way to Sixth you can tell that some time ago there
were many porn shops, closed down probably during the early years of the Lugh
Surehand administration's attempts to cure urban blight here in the main port
city of Tir Tairngire.  The bars that have moved into the shopfronts have left
up a few of the signs and posters, despite government 'obscenity' crackdowns.

   Along the north side of the street are a collection of broken down Tri-Met
buses, wrecked, bent up, and piled upon each other.  They have become
multilevel homes for squatters.  Along the windows of one of the "upper
levels" is some graffiti, reading "^cSquare Puppiez RULE^n".  The rain has rusted
the buses to a great extent, creating ruddy trails down from the roof of the
Tri-Met buses to the red stripes along side the buses.

   Passing the myriad of Tri-Met busses, the incline of the hill begins to
become noticible.  To the north was once a bar, with many of its windows
shattered out and replaced by plasticrete panels.  There are bars on the door
to prevent breakins, and it seems that there are intrusion countermeasures of
the physical variety, sensors and such to prevent anyone on the street from
going inside the building.

   Standing at a bustling intersection, steam rises from the sewer manhole
vents, as the scent of a brewry pervades.  Perfect Synch with the setting sun
lights come up and you see yourself before the mighty Powells bookstore, in
all its glory.  With the setting sun, this full city block sized bookstore
seems to jump to life.

   Standing at the base of the stairs, the river is in sight to the east, and
Second Street moves north and south, though sees no traffic, as it is the road
the MAX train system uses exclusively.  Across Second Street is the location
of the Saturday Market.

   There is an ATM mounted to the wall, and carved below it are the words
"^RKat's Pad^n".  This is obviously the home of a squatter.  There are places
where bedrolls are laid out at night, and the smell here is atrocious.  Best
move along, chummer.

Desc:$
   This small, fluorescently-lit store looks like it hasn't been cleaned since
1997. Trash lines the walks, most of the tile floor seems to be a moldy green
and the stench of rotting corpses fills your nostrils. To top it all off, a
lot of the food is packaged in strange-looking wrappers.

   Standing on the curb, the vibrations of the darkwave and techno music
inside can be felt from here. To the east is the portal to inter, with a
rather large female elf in sight. She must be the bouncer. The streets in this
section of the city fill with steam from the sewers grates and vents.

   Here is where the sound equipment goes from huge to gargantuan.  This area
is full of elves being rocked by the beat, literally.  Some of these tunes are
familiar, isnt that nilaya by that 90's trance group Astral Projection?  Ohh a
remake of Annie Lexnox and the eurithmyc's "Here comes the rain again" as done
by the cruxsadows.

   Excellent chums, we're here.  This is the zeneth of the club.  These are
the best of the best shaking their stuff here.  As you stand here on the
vibrating stage you see what is likely to be the most beautiful elf you have
ever seen. Through dark walnut coloured hair her peircing eyes catch yours
just for a second, then her eyes drop again in concentration of the entrancing
dance she is performing.

   Filled with wiggling writhing bodies rolling with the music.  The sweet
musk of sweat permiates the room,  as desire rolls over the dancers, their
movements become more prounounced, adn mroe needfull.  As teh music
creshendo's, so does this almost primal dance.

   On this side of the stage it looks like somehting akin to employee seating
from the 5th age, when the place was built.  Almost like a wooden stadium
seating kinda bench.  Doesn't look to safe but it is stuffed with little woe
ridden elves in all their 5th age gothic glory.  They are over looking the
stage, those who are not indulging in the lips or bodies of another that is.

   Another entrance to the dance floor.  As you look out over the club, its
obvious as to why this is one of Portlands hotspots.  For people who love the
old retro styles of darkwave, gothic, trance, and industrial, this place sure
hits the spot. nothing better than some good tunes chum.  Hmm is that "On the
edge"  the old theme song from a WWF wrestler?

   The sweet smell of passion fills this part of the room. There are many
elves here, rested against the wall and each other. Some are sitting while
others neck on the dilapidated couches and theater seats. Moving along
slightly, there appears to be a small tunnel behind some of the seats. Just
ahead is the edge of the stage.

Name:	The dancefloor
Desc:$
   A pulsing beat, writhing elven bodies. This is the dancefloor, filled to
the brim with people dressed in artsy dark gothic clothes. The dancers seem to
move in perfect sync, despite a general discord in their styles. Like a shoal
of fish they swarm and scatter in perfect harmony. As you feel the vibration
and music wash over you, the magical effects pull at you to join them.

Name:	Inzerakh's Chamber
Desc:$
   Darkness surrounds, and terror follows.  The feeling of light is fading
from you quickly, and soon another scream cries for releaf from somewhere in
the darkness.  Hope, there is none, pleasure, non existant.  An eeriee green
glow kicks up and you see bodies, not dead ones but suffering live people,
dangling from chains, and needles or rings inserted in various parts of their
body.  Low moans accompany their obvious suffering, and woe.  Still as the
light brightens, you see teeth marks on their flesh, and places where the whip
has also bitten through the tender skin. In the middle of it all, there is a
place, with blood stained feathers around it, that looks to be the resting
place of their torturer.
