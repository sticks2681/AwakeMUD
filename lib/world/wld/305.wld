Name:	Easy Diver Coffin Motel
Desc:$
   Its a cheap rathole of a coffin motel, with thirty meters of coffins
stacked on top of each other, separated by ladders.  They are painted yellow
with black doors, giving it a yellowjacket-like color, overall. There is a
grimy dirty man playing solitaire at the front desk which is little more than
a metal table with an old PC on it to keep track of customers.

Desc:$
   This rather plain white room is full of clean steel racks upon which with
various items of clothing are hung up in an orderly manner. The little
orange-and-red lettered signs taped to the racks advertise specials such as
"All Underwear, 30% Off" and "Men's Sweatshirts, 20% Off." The floor is plain
white, with silver-speckled linoleum, and appears to have been recently mopped
and waxed.

   On the east side of the road, the high wooden fences split into a muddy
rutted alley dotted with dumpsters, a stray cat idly picking its way around
the puddles.  To the west is the back of a small red brick building, the large
outline of a black dragon in spray paint staring across an empty paved lot
that stretches southwest to the small gas station the next block over, on 5th
street.

   To the west, traffic speeds from Fifth Street, onto Harrison and towards
the onramp, where the tree-lined blocks of houses abruptly come to an end.
Kids are running around towards the eastern end of the street, obviously with
orders from their parents to avoid the turn off. A large green metal sign,
nearly hidden by a mass of rosebushes and looking very out of place among the
trees and gardens, advertises the onramp link to Intercity 5.

seen any sort of worker in them for nearly a decade.  Northward on Tenth
Street there are a few shopping centers on one side of the street, office
buildings on another.  Franklin Associates is erecting a new Fire Control
complex east of here.

   North Ninth runs northward towards the Aztechnology Pyramid and Magic

southeast district where Renraku Arcology and Seattle Center are located.  As
far as media bombardment goes, this intersection puts Times Square to shame,
with vast trideo full-motion billboards advertising every product imaginable
at every hour.  Large groups of people cross the streets at regular intervals,
and wait at other times.  A sign is up on top of the streetlight apparatus,
saying in green, ^GJunction I-90, 1/2 km south^n.

   Espanoza Way ends a half a block east of here, where it runs into Tenth,
the edge of the northwest sector.  The street is lined with tall prefab
buildings of a dull gray concrete color, with very dull rectangular windows in
a predictible pattern.  Inside the windows you can see bored office workers,
just pretending to do their jobs.  On the lower levels, there are storefronts
selling mostly foreign foods of obscure varieties, from Moroccan to Romanian.
The air is clogged with smog, and very few would run around these streets
without their breathers on, unless they got the constitution of Hercules
post-goblinization, or want to live a very short life.

highway; a break in the wall allows entrance to the onramp to I-5. The wall is
spotlessly clean, and free from all graffiti, and the sidewalks have been
decorated with crudely-drawn chalk portraits of flowers and suns, probably the
work of children. A small park with a few benches and a memorial stone sits in
the cul-de-sac that marks the end of Highland Drive.

   The trunks of the trees that line this portion of the street are a strange
orange color, perhaps due to the use of some new fertilizer. The residences
here all seem to be updated versions of the ranch style that became so popular
in the 1970s; they're all pastel-colored, and have an assortment of electric
cars and vans parked in their driveways. Lone Star officers and the occasional
private security guard walk up and down the sidewalks, alongside a mix of
well-dressed elves and humans.

   A dull black traffic light sways from a cable overhead, its lights
flickering, and a few skidmarks along one side of the road tell of some
narrowly-avoided accident. The residences along this portion of the street are
a mixture of two-story houses and small co-ops. One of the lampposts along the
sidewalk also features a smog meter. Since most of the people walking by seem
not to be wearing any breathers, the readings are probably fairly good.

Desc:$
   UCAS pride seems to be a common point among the residents here, as the red,
white and blue flag flies from many of the porches. Tidy, well-kept picket
fences border some houses; others have open yards. The green-and-silver street
sign at the corner shows Fourth Street going north and south, and Valley Road
traveling east and west.

   The houses here become more sparce as lawns and houses themselves become
larger. Elegent but plain two-story houses give way to those with two car
gargages and pools in back. The occasional trampoline lends the feel of
children and other miscreants of the middle-class.

   The surrounding neighborhood is nicer than most you might expect to find in
a city sprawl of any kind, yet there are still classic reminders that you're
in the sprawl and not some fancy suburb. Various things like tall, boxlike, if
posh, apartment complexes obscure a clear view of the horizon from any
viewpoint. The large building to the south that is the Matchstick Nightclub is
another reminder of the sprawl, and the ramp leading to an underground garage
likely used as loading/unloading for the club further jars the memory.

protection from the criminals who plague much of the rest of Seattle. Lone
Star foot patrolmen walk through the parking lots, and patrol vehicles cruise
the streets. Some children play across the street in a small park, which has a
baseball diamond, basketball court, jungle gym and other sources of amusement.

children, and a deep voice, most likely their father, playing with them.

   The vehicles and pedestrians that traverse this section of street tend
towards the upper class - the cars are new and expensive, and the people are
well-dressed. The houses and apartment buildings here look fairly pricey and
well cared-for, as well. Both Lone Star police and patrol vehicles are a
constant presence here, as one would expect in such an obviously wealthy
neighborhood. A small, single-story office building is sandwiched between two
large houses to the south; a discreet grey plaque on its door reads,
"Sixth-Age Clinical Consulting."

   The wealthiness of the neighborhood is made evident by the high-end shops
and fancy residential buildings that occupy its well-kept sidewalks and the
many expensive new cars that cruise along the immaculately-paved street. With
money comes protection, and the Lone Star presence in the area is strong.
Several cars can be seen on the side of the road, pulled over for traffic
violations. A biosculpting shop to the southeast offers expensive cosmetic
enhancements for those who can afford them; Northwest Seventh continues to the
north, and Valley Road stretches east and west.

   Northwest Fourth intersects with Denny Way here, continuing north towards a

   Denny Way continues here, and to the north more residential complexes rise
to the sky in parts, while other areas look suspiciously empty.  Must be
actual houses there.  The occasional Dodge Scoot toodles by, intermixed with
better looking cars like Eurocars and Saabs.

   Denny Way continues on here, intersecting with Third Street, which heads
north towards Highland and the -really- ritzy residential areas.  A
dilapidated house sits here, surrounded by a chain link fence with police tape
proclaiming it to be abandoned.  Tell that to the elderly male sitting on the
porch with his Defiance T-250.

   Some of the last apartment complexes in this area sit here, the three-story
developments looking to be catering to families numbering in the threes or
fours.  Some have a gate leading inside, but the majority either do not, or
the gate doesn't work, rendering it useless.  The open-air parking lot seems
to be a hotbed of criminal activity, of the grand theft auto variety. Better
watch your stereo.

through meters of tarmac and plasticrete, from the buzzing of motorcycles to
the wall of sound created when a cargo truck passes overhead. A relatively
unassuming club is to the north.

NightDesc:$
   While empty during the day, at night the area under the overpass is packed
to the brim with deckers waiting to get into Syberspace, the hottest club for
anyone who's anyone on the Matrix. Loud, thumping techno can be heard
eminating from the club to the north, a massive light show lighting up the
area in an assortment of hues.

several couches, black leather, for patrons to relax in.  A reception counter

eyes glow from the shadows in very direction. What first appears to be a
raised tentacle lies across the floor.  Closer examination would reveal an
intricate painting, made to give depth to the two dimenional tile. The entire
hallway is dark, and almost appears to be a large room, but from the echos of
sounds, the length and depth of the hallway can be imagined.

   A difference on this floor, other than its darker, more evil decor, is the
lack of a window. In its place is the same black wall, with the staring red
eyes, glowing, like beasts ready to attack at any moment. Again, tentacles
sprawl across the floor, attempting to entangle a weary travler, and have
their way with him. The doors to 3C, to the East, and  3D to the West are
here, and where the peephole should be is a single forboding eye, a darker
crimson, and its style is like it was drawn with fresh blood, as it has drips
that ran down the door a short way. The spookiness of the hallway alone would
be sufficent protection against prowlers, visitors, and Jehovah's Witnessess.

   Not a typical lobby, it contains the same level of decor as the other
floors, but in an outdoor motif.  Reminiscent of the old Pacific Northwest,
the walls display old redwoods, and the floor is a tiled mural, made to look
like the floor of a forest, complete with leaves and undergrowth.  The lights
are dim, maybe for privacy, maybe for the lack of light underneath the massive
canopy's of the giant trees.  Suites are found to the south.

the dim light. The ceiling has lighter spots, to represent the sky from

peephole for security. 4A is to the East while 4B is to the West.  Southwards

street below.  Just as high, and even higher than, some of the surrounding
buildings, the view of the city itself is quite decent. The window, embedded
in a Redwood trunk, is draped with moss covered vines, and ferns surrounding
the bottom. The suites, 4C, to the East, and 4D, to the West, are found here,
in the dim rainforest.

Desc:$
   In reference to Seattle Harbor's history, the motif for this floor is done
as an ocean liner. Somewhat painted like a grand ballroom, there is a
magnificent blue and gold carpet, huge wooden doors in which the elevator is
contained, and lovely scenery of dancers, chandeliers, waiters with trays, and
everything that the artist could imagine. Southwards the suites lie.

   The large room, painted within the moderate hallway, expands the space,
giving a sense of depth to a flat wall. There are doors to the east, 5A, and
west, 5B.  They are elegant, like what would be only allowable in a high class
ballroom. The "guests", painted as happy customers, enjoying themselves
greatly, seem to make almost a cheerful feeling within the hallway. Northwards
is the elevator lobby, whilist, south are more suites.

   At the far end of the ballroom there is two doors and a window. The window,
it's perimeter a 2 inwide, decorated gold frame, represents a large mirror in
the room.  It looks over the street, five stories beneath, and the buildings
of Seattle, large and small, can be seen, expanding far out.  The doors, large
and strong, are 5C, to the east, and 5D to the west. Around them the ballroom
expands northward towards the elevator. There is what appears to be a bar,
tended by several people, with vaarious customers drinking from glasses, mugs,
chalices, even martini glasses. All in all it is the end of a magnificent and
detailed scene.

   A grand bedroom, fit for a king himself, has everything.  A king size bed,

with all sorts of clothes.  On the wall to the foot of the bed is a half inch
thick trid screen, that takes up most the wall.
