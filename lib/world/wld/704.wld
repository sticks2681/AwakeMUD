Name:	Along an island path
Desc:$
   This pathway is flanked upon each side by thick and lush tropical forest,
which is spread out to the far edges of this island paradise. The pathway
itself leads up from the private beach down towards the southern end of the
island, while off a little ways the pathway branches off to the northwest and
northeast, both traveling some distance into the jungle-like interior of this
land.

Name:	An wide entrance corridor
Desc:$
   A large archway entrance leads into the lobby of the estate, its floors
layered in a pattern of subdued turquoise and eggshell white ceramic tiles.
The initial corridor that leads into the building is quite wide, its rustic
wooden walls populated with various paintings and pictures, some of the nearby
scenery upon the island, while others are of distance places halfway around
the world from here. Two doorways face each other from across the entrance
corridor, one on the east side, and one upon the west side, while another
expansive archway leads off to the north deeper into the establishment.

   Everything in this large washroom is scrupulously clean, including its
^Wwhite^N ceramic tile floors and matching walls, its pattern occasionally broken
up by an hexagon of ^Lblack^N marble tile. The room features several windows,
along with a large panoramic window that offers a spectacular view of the
island scenery beyond its walls. The lighting is offered by decorative lamps
hung along the walls, which offer a dim, subdued amount of light that keeps
the room from being uncomfortably bright.

Name:	In a spacious guest room
Desc:$
   You find yourself in a cozy, relaxing room. The floor is a forest green
carpet, and the walls are paneled in weathered oak. In one corner a large trid
unit hangs from the ceiling. Two small sofas are set a little ways away,
facing it, with a small glass table in the center of the arrangement. A SOTA
sound-system sits under the trid unit. In the other corner is a small
refrigerator, storing food for guests. To the far east side of the room sits
an oak table and matching chairs, a small computer sitting on one head of the
table. Illumination is provided by a combination light and fan hung from the
ceiling. The fan is controlled by a small thermostat mounted near the door,
keeping the room at a nice cool temperature.

windows line the walls, showing off the scenery of lush green tropical forest
that surrounds the building, each of which is lined with various potted

types of furnishings, offering plenty of seating for at least several dozen
guests. An entertainment system lines the far wall, which consists of several
widescreen trideo screens and other electronic devices, flanked with tall

concealed speakers tucked away into the corners of the room, as well as the
ceiling.

Desc:$
   Your feet sink into deep ^Lblack^N carpeting as you enter this large, cozy
office. The walls are paneled in knotty pine and are lined with filing
cabinets and bookshelves over-flowing with books, ledgers and datadisks. A
large desk of fine mahogany stands in the center of the room, with several
high-backed leather chairs behind it. It sports a state-of-the-art computer
and all the essential peripherals, as well as a sundry of other items: notes,
invoices, framed photographs, and of course the proverbial coffee cups. A wide
window faces the desk, giving anyone who sits at it an unencumbered view of
the beautiful island scenery outside. A small chandelier, with crystal prisms
dangling from it, hangs from the ceiling and gives off a warm, albeit dim
glow.

Name:	Before a private island estate
Desc:$
   What appears to be a massive private estate has been built upon this
island, undoubtedly by its owner. The design is expansive, but tastefully
concealed and woven into the tropical forest that surrounds it until it almost
seems as if it should have existed there all along. There appears to be quite
a lot of wood used in its construction, as opposed to more modern materials,
most likely from the native trees that grow all around the expansive island in
the middle of the Caribbean Sea. The stone and mason work, however, don't seem
to be native to this part of the world, and were most likely shipped in at
quite some expense to the owner.
