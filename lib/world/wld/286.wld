Desc:$
   Blood. All over the walls, the ceiling, and clotting slowly on the floor.
At one time, the walls were painted a light blue, but now simply serve as a
canvas for some insane tribute to the dead. In the center of this spectacle is
a wooden sign, whitewashed, with bloody lettering: "If you're Rifkin and you
know it, self-delete before Bob notices you."

Name:	A Completely Decimated Building
Desc:$
   Here stands a large pile of severely beaten, burnt, bullet-riddled and
magically-destroyed debris. A tattered sign half-buried in a crater reads:
"Lone Star Precinct, Redmond Branch." Scraps of torn metal that seem to be
from both vehicles and personal armor litter the area. Shattered glass is
scattered everywhere; two particularly twisted piles of metal might once have
been an Ares Riotmaster and a cargo helicopter.

    This is the foyer to the offices. To the west is the wing for all
confiscated weapons. Southeast and southwest bring you to the actual Main
Office. A glance through this room shows that everything needs to be repaired,
or at least dusted off. The carpet is threadbare and dirty, the walls have
huge stains from only god knows what and a large, but broken, chandelier
suspended from above.

a Spas-12, and a PSG-1 are just a few of the older ones. The hallway continues

   The man behind the counter grins and chuckles everytime someone is shocked

a deal, "Hey you... I'll sell you this here crimson for 400k...," then he

Name:	Defense Armor
Desc:$
   Tactical home defense armor lines the walls here.  All of this armor is
totally legal, but only stops a few types of bullets.  There are racks holding
Kevlar vests and leggings, combat boots, and other simple civilian devices.
Some military supplus items are here like a ballistical riot shield, and some
simple riot head gear. For the most part all the armor here is simple and
affordable to the every day chum.

Desc:$
   As you descend into the sewer, you are greeted not by darkness and dank
air, but by flourescent lighting and warmth.  The smell, if any, is of clean
sweat and gun oil.
   The room is filled with maps, folders strewn about on tables, weaponry
piled haphazardly, and people...people mill around, talking and arguing about
different strategies.  This is the Myrmidon Headquarters, the hub of mercenary
activity in the Seattle area.

   Surprising to see, this is a small chop shop.  With new, and used,
Cyberware for sale, this isn't an offensive place to come.  Most of the
cyberware is Lone Star issue, coming from either Lone Star warehouses that
stock these for their Cyber-Zombie super soldiers, or the super soldiers
themselves.

   This is the "back room" so to speak of the station.  Harder to get into

within can almost be smelt.  It wouldn't be to far of a stretch to think there
may be drool stains on the floor.

   Just a typical hallway seperating The Rifle Shop and The Armor Shop.  It is
dimly lit, adding a mysterious atmosphere, rightly so, for not too many people
have ever set foot in this hallway or seen the hardware in the shops.  Or even
have heard of the hardware in the shops.

   All sorts of types of armor hang from the walls.  Prices vary, but for the
most part, they are reasonable, for the armor is top of the line.  This is the
good stuff.  The prototypes, the secret, black-op military grade armor that
even the most heavily armored runners have wet dreams about.
