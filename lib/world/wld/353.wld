Name:	sanctuary
Desc:$
   You stand upon the cold rock floor of a dimly-lit room. A freezing breeze
sweeps by you from a narrowly cut window in the nearby rock wall. Looking out
from the window you realize the ground to be a great distance away. Shimmering
a pale white, the snow-covered ground comes to life in the light of the moon.
Apparently set in the peak of an enormous mountain, the room boats no other
entrances or exits. A light rain accompanies the snow and sends the sky into a
beautiful torrent of excitement. A candle-lit desk and books fill this small
room. Enchanted by the calming view outside, you peacefully sit in the
sanctuary of digitaimos.

Name:	A narrow passageway
Desc:$
   You stand in a very narowly-cut hallway. Sporting no sign of accomodation
or personal posession, the hallway appears to be more of a /tunnel/ than
anything else. The walls are made up of rigid sone, making distinguishing
between them and the cold rock floor or low ceiling impossible save the
candelight that flickers here. A chill breeze sweeps through from the east,
while a mechanical humm can be heard from the west.

Name:	Digitaimos' garage
Desc:$
   The ceiling rises considerably to compensate for the abundant ammount of
vehicles present here. The candlelight subsides to a flourescent flicker as
you make your way deeper into the garage. All of the surrounding walls (save
the east) boast reflecting pools of water framed in gun-metal ^Lgray^n structures.
Arcane elven symbols engraved into the frames glow a deep ^bblue ^nat random,
sending shockwaves throught the great spances of water. A holographic display
spins a numerical whirlwind in the middle of the room, illuminating various
locations throughout seattle (and beyond) in a mysterious synchronization with
the symbols.

Desc:$
   The cave opens into a large room furnished with antique furniture atop a
huge maroon carpet. Several individuals are seated on the two couches in the
middle of the room, and are deep in conversation. More still stand in front of
a large, crystal-clear window that serves as the east wall and peer out into
the light snowfall.

Name:	The vault [item storage]
Desc:$
   Your heels click on white tile as you step into a large room surrounded by
industrial shelving and hooks of various sizes. Flourescent lights flicker
sporadically, and cast odd shadows about the many items that are stored here.
Weapons ranging from pistols and other small firearms to a troll-sized rocket
launcher are displayed on the west wall, while various garments adorn the
east. If Digitaimos were a collector of anything, this would be his showroom
of everything.

Name:	The obstructed path
Desc:$
   A congested alleyway forms around you, awash with patrons browsing the many
makeshift shops which adorn each side. Bright decorations fuse with sweet
incense and string music to mimic a chinatown market, yet something seems
amiss. Every window of the surrounding buildings boasts a figure looking down
towards the steet, but covering his or her eyes with their hands. On the far
north wall of the alley a closed lotus blossom has been painted.

   A deep, rythmic beat can barely be heard as you make your way down the
alley. Though the sourrounding warehouses show no sign of recent life, you
can't help but feel that something's amiss. Large dumpsters clutter the
allready packed alleyway, and steam clouds your vision from a nearby sewer
drain.

   The inside of the ^Rrusty ^ndumpster is remarkably clean and spatious. A small
collection of candy wrappers and empty water bottles clutters the floor of the
otherwise spotless dumpster. To the north, a small yet precise hole has been
cut through the dumpster wall and into the neighboring warehouse.

   The bass begins to tingle the back of your throat as you make your way into
the /obviously/ occupied warehouse. Immense crates tower above you in all
directions save the east, which, as far as you can tell, serves as the source
of the beat. Behind you, a hole has been carefully broken in the southern wall
of the warehouse.
