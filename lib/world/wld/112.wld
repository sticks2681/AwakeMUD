Name:	Before a towering building
Desc:$
   Before you looms a towering sky scraper reaching to the clouds themselves.
Wageslaves scurry in and out of the revolving doors at its front, as security
guards prowl the premises.  Luxurious, and well kept gardens are off to the
east and west as you walk down the walkway towards the door.

Name:	Down the walkway
Desc:$
   You step onto the walkway heading north towards the building.  The pavement
of the city changes into the marble of big business.  Off to your east and
west you have access to the gardens designed for employee breaks out of the
complex.  Wage slaves continue to move in and out of the building as appearing
to have somewhere to go, and no time to get there.  You notice various
security guards eyeing you cautiously.

   You enter the lobby of the building and feel a sense of insignificance wash
over you at the enormity of it all.  Directly in front of you is a large glass
case with what appears to be a chunk of glass cut with various angles
reflecting light in all directions.  Standing close to the case you notice a
shaft that must reach to the upper most heights of the building allowing sun
light to beam directly to the chunk of glass.
