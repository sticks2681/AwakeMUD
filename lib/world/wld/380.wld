   The sound of traffic from outside is barely audible here, but it echoes
down the entrance ramp and through the garage.  Large cement pillars support
the building above you yet add to the maze of vehciles that is already present
here.  To your north you can hear the sounds of people moving about from
upstairs, inside the complex.

   The sound of traffic from outside is barely audible here, but it echoes
down the entrance ramp and through the garage. Large cement pillars support
the building above and obstruct your vision, making it even more difficult to
maneuver through the maze of vehicles. To your north you can hear the sounds
of people moving around, inside the complex upstairs.

array of burgers, even in the food stall here, and they always tend to be
quick with their service.  This particular Nuke-It Burger happens to have a
foyer stall of the food court, and if you look beyond the counter and the
cooking vats, you can see the other buildings of Seattle.

sky, as do the other buildings in the surrounding area of Seattle. A panel on
the north wall of the tube controls the elevator.

domed ceiling, nullifies the noise from the food court and parking garage.

Name:	An Office
Desc:$
   This office is of a decent size, and pretty fancy.  A large red rug lies on
the tiled floor, in the middle of the room, with a large oak desk on it.  The
top of the desk is scattered with various papers and a cyberterminal which
seems to be offline.  The ceiling of the room is domed and a large glass ball
with a light inside of it hangs from the peak of the dome.

A-List Shadowrunners can be seen shopping here.  They supposedly require SINs
for purchases, but a significant amount of their stock is 'shoplifted' on a
regular basis, and it is rumored that they do extensive business with several
well known money launderers.  The clerk sits behind an ultramodern black
macroglass display case and mostly answers questions and rings in purchases.
A sign on top of the case describes the items for sale.

often which he keeps for himself.  Despite that, he does have some stuff out

Name:	Bunny's Office
Desc:$
   This cramped little office is a mess of papers, envelopes and boxes. A
small bin on the floor is marked "Incoming," and is probably there for people
to leave deliveries in. A large oak desk in the office's center is covered
with electronics equipment and old computer terminals.

Desc:$
   Fresh air and street noise barely mingle with the atmosphere of Smith's Pub
here.  The crowd is light it seems, but the atmosphere is strictly business.
The music, coming from somewhere overhead, is light, very mellow, and easily
heard over at close range when speaking.

Name:	The Entrance to Smith's Pub
Desc:$
   Standing just inside the doors of Smith's Pub you find it be darkly lit,
and somehow quiet, yet it has it's very own atomsphere here. Jimmy Smith, the
owner, is backed by the Mafia, rumors has it, so this is a fairly safe place
to conduct deals as far as staying away from Lone Star.

possibly leather, as is the edging of the counter top.

electricity in the air, possibly white noise.  The wall itself has years of
indentation on it, from the various people who've tried to start fight's at
Smith's and had their legs handed to them by Jimmy's bouncer, the Troll Gorg.

Name:	A Computer Room
Desc:$
   The hum of electronics and computers is almost overwhelming. Four monitors
sit against a wall, data constantly flooding their screens. Amidst the mess is
a cyberterminal, already hooked up to a Matrix connection, just waiting for
someone to plug in.

door, which are re-inforced with plasteel plates and heavy bars.  Inside,
numerous security guards wander about, checking peoples SIN's and permits.

   The lobby of Auburn Street Gear is sparesly populated with a few fake
potted plants.  Numerous guards parade through, all armed to the teeth with
various kinds of weaponry.  Hallways lead off in various directions, signs
over their entrance ways to help people around the building.  To the south is
an ^Rexit^N sign, and next to that hallway, heading southwest is another hallway
marked ^Cpermits^N.  To the west, north and east are more hallways, marked
^Ymilitary^N, ^Gsecurity^N, ^Bcivilian^N.  Southeast has another hallway, bending
somewhere out of sight, which is marked ^Mspecial operations^N.

apparently seen more wear and tear than the others, as the walls are a thinned
color of paint, as opposed to the full yellow color that the rest of the

   This hallway is shadowy and off from the rest of the building.  It
obviously doesn't attract as much attention from customers either because the
walls look as if they've never had a hand laid on them.  Over head the lights
are dimmed to near darkness, almost to the point where you can't make out the
shape of the guard standing infront of you.
