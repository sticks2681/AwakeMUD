Name:	At the loading pier behind Lacoste's
Desc:$
   Several docks and piers stretch themselves out into the water behind the
boat showroom, which is where all of the purchased vehicles are loaded out for
either rental or purchase. There is also a public marina used by the locals to
keep theirs from drifting off with the tide, but the area offers more than
enough room to handle all types and sizes of watercraft.

Name:	A DocWagon Recovery Room
Desc:$
   This is where DocWagon parks its recovering patients: a bare white room
furnished with little more than a hospital bed, a side table and a host of
monitoring machinery. Fluorescent light reflects harshly off the shiny
linoleum floors. A door to the south presumably leads out of here.

Name:	Inside a DocWagon Lifeguard station
Desc:$
   This DocWagon Lifeguard station is located right off the shoreline so
medical personnel can pull right into it off of the water and offload their
patients. The wall behind the polished wooden counter here is filled with
video screens showing DocWagon Life Guard teams pulling their clients out of
all sorts of dangerous situations. Just the kind of thing to inspire
confidence in even the most hardened of ocean runners.

Name:	A small jetty off the shoreline
Desc:$
   This jetty acts as a port for locals to anchor their ocean going vessels,
and while it may not be the largest one around, it certainly gets the job done
just fine. Shallow water is a bit further to the south, beyond which it meets
up with the beach and shoreline, while off in the other direction is Sauteurs
Bay and the ocean beyond that, which stretches out to the horizon and past it.

Name:	Onto the beach
Desc:$
   A stretch of sandy beach travels along the shoreline as it meets up with
the waters of Sauteurs Bay, the ocean stretching out beyond it to the horizon,
and beyond. The waves lap and wash up onto the sand, creating an idyllic
atmosphere and scenery for tourists and locals alike. The occasional boat
passing by in the distance sounds off as it chugs along, the seascape dotted
with sailing vessels and other watercraft of every shape and size.

Name:	Along the beach
Desc:$
   The sand beneath your feet is warm to the touch, even during the night time
hours, but its contrast with the cool breeze that billows in off of the water
makes it more than bearable. The air is salty, which is to be expected
ofcourse, making for the perfect beach experience. The occasional sound of
people playing in the shallows nearby only slightly disrupts the calm and
surreal scenery, since it's kind of hard to get annoyed by anything in a place
like this.

Desc:$
   It appears that most of the visitors here are gathered around the front of
this small beach front establishment, the reason for which becomes quite
obvious when you realize they serve booze. If sitting and relaxing in the sun
isn't your idea of a good time, you can just as well spend your stay here in
the shade of the enclosed bar nearby with a cold drink in hand.

   The beach thins out a little as far as visitors go, with the occasional
local taking their place. A collection of small bancas can be seen anchored
just off the shoreline in the shallows, most likely owned by local fisherman,
since that's still a trade that's alive and well even in this day and age. A
small building marks the sandy landscape off to the east, while another larger
building pokes out into the water nearby to the west, though it's hard to tell
what it's used for from this vantage point.

Name:	Along the beach, near a DocWagon Station
Desc:$
   The sandy beach continues along until it reaches a building that is built
half on the shoreline and half in the water, the rear of which seems to be
constructed to accomodate small watercraft so they can dock and immediately
offload their passengers. The building in question appears to be a DocWagon
station, and considering that its situated upon the shorefront, chances are it
deals in the matter of rescues out on the open water or the smaller islands
that dot the ocean nearby.

Name:	In the shallows near the beach
Desc:$
   A collection of bancas from local fishermen are gathered in this area,
where they are anchored to keep from drifting out further into the sea. The
shallow waters near the beach that stretches along the shoreline for quite a
distance are populated with various types of aquatic sealife, most of which
keep clear of the deeper parts of Sauteurs Bay beyond them in hopes of
avoiding some of the larger predators that are known to stalk their depths.
Unfortunately, that also means beach goers are more apt to stumble or step
upon some of the more dangerous types that call these waters home, such as the
different types of jellyfish and sea urchins, neither of which would prove fun
to trip over during your splash. A building situated off to the west appears
to be some type of lifeguard station, or at least that's what it looks like
from this vantage point.

Name:	In the shallows near the beach
Desc:$
   The shallow waters near the beach that stretches along the shoreline for
quite a distance are populated with various types of aquatic sealife, most of
which keep clear of the deeper parts of Sauteurs Bay beyond them in hopes of
avoiding some of the larger predators that are known to stalk their depths.
Unfortunately, that also means beach goers are more apt to stumble or step
upon some of the more dangerous types that call these waters home, such as the
different types of jellyfish and sea urchins, neither of which would prove fun
to trip over during your splash.

   This sandy stretch of coast juts out into the waters and offers the perfect
landing area for any watercraft attempting to get onto this small island.
Beyond this piece of shoreline the island is all but enveloped with lush
greenery, its terrain covered from shore to shore with thick tropical forest
with only a few makeshift service trails cut into its interior to allow
passage on foot.

Name:	A small inlet on Green Island
Desc:$
   This small cove allows ships to drop anchor and ferry aboard to the small
island, better known as Green Island, aptly named due to the fact it is
covered in lush tropical forest. While abandoned of (meta)human inhabitants,
it is still heavily populated by native wildlife, most of which are on the
smaller side, ranging from small mammals to a wide range and species of
insects. Crudely cut game trails lead off in different directions from the
landing cove to other portions of the islands interior.

Name:	Onto to Sandy Island
Desc:$
   This sparsely vegetated and uninhabited patch of rocky terrain is thrust up
from the depths of the ocean, being one of the smaller islands around this
part of the Caribbean Sea. The rough terrain makes the approach to this island
dangerous and outright impossible with any type of watercraft, and instead,
the only way to reach its shores is by good old fashioned arm and leg strength
and a brief swim.

Name:	On Bird Island
Desc:$
   Past the rocky shores and wave beaten coast, which is an adventure in its
own right, the island greets those who step foot upon it with an almost
impassable thicket of tropical forest, which blankets almost the entire island
in a maze of trees and foliage. There doesn't appear to be any signs of
inhabitation, for obvious reasons, as the remote nature of this piece of land
coupled with the inability to land a ship on it makes it the ideal place to
search out some of the less tame species that make their home in the Caribbean
Sea.

down any small water going vessels, almost all of which are owned by lease
holders here at Pelagie Waterfront Apartments. Waves casually splash about the
posts that are sunk down into the ocean bed off the shore a ways, making it
nice and sturdy and keeping it from being pulled free by any riptides.

while north is the ocean itself, which stretches out to the horizon and
beyond. The occasional sailing boat and ship passes through the area,
apparently on their way into or out of the bay area.

Name:	Heading out into Sauteurs Bay
Desc:$
   Sauteurs Bay looms out into the ocean waters near the island of Grenada
nearby, whose shoreline is visible a short ways towards the south from here,
while north is the ocean itself, which stretches out to the horizon and
beyond. The occasional sailing boat and ship passes through the area,
apparently on their way into or out of the bay area. There is a pier system
set up just east of the bay here, where quite a number of watercraft can be
seen anchored and tied down to safe keeping.

Desc:$
   Sauteurs Bay leads out into the open waters beyond as it flows out into the
ocean, which stretches out into the horizon as far as the eye can see, its
seascape dotted with the occasional sailing craft and other boats as they
float through the bay. Several docks are set up along the shore, their piers
pushing out into the shallows, some of which are for the local ferry that
carries passengers about from the main island to other smaller islands nearby.

are anchored along a pier.

   Sauteurs Bay travels around the northern edge of the island of Grenada,
crossing an outcropping of land known as Laurant Point as one travels through
the waters nearby. Several sail boats and smaller fishing vessels round the
point as they head out into deeper ocean waters, with the occasional
commercial vessel dotting the seascape as well. The shoreline is easily
visible a short distance away to the south.

Name:	Out in Sauteurs Bay
Desc:$
   Sauteurs Bay, just north of the island of Grenada, stretches out into the
wild blue yonder as it opens up into the waters of the Caribbean Sea. The
waves aren't too rough most of the time, with only the occasional swell
causing any noticable disturbance with the passage of boats and ships as they
maneuver their way around the ocean. Native sea birds can be seen flying
around in the sky, which tend not to stray too far out into the open water
without a good reason, so its safe to say by their presence that your vessel
is still close to land.

Name:	Out in Sauteurs Bay
Desc:$
   Sauteurs Bay, just north of the island of Grenada, stretches out into the
wild blue yonder as it opens up into the waters of the Caribbean Sea. The
waves aren't too rough most of the time, with only the occasional swell
causing any noticable disturbance with the passage of boats and ships as they
maneuver their way around the ocean. A jetty nearby to the southeast has
various boats and watercraft of every shape and size, though most are probably
privately owned vessels considering the smaller scale of the pier system for
them to dock at.

Desc:$
   Sauteurs Bay sweeps along the this northern edge of the island of Grenada,
stretching out into the wild blue yonder before it opens up into the waters of
the Caribbean Sea beyond. A system of docks are set up to accomodate the
constant traffic of passenger ferrys as they drift in and out of the bay. A
jetty nearby to the southwest has various boats and watercraft of every shape
and size, though most are probably privately owned vessels considering the
smaller scale of the pier system for them to dock at. The city of Sauteurs is
clearly visible beyond the coastline, though a good portion of it is obscured
by swathes of trees and foliage.

causing any noticable disturbance with the passage of boats and ships as they

around in the sky, which tend not to stray too far out into the open water
without a good reason, so its safe to say by their presence that your vessel
is still close to land.

   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
island of Grenada can be seen off in the distance to the south, though it's
hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the waves
have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean rocking
the watercraft you're on.

Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
island of Grenada can be seen off in the distance to the south, though it's
hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the waves
have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean rocking
the watercraft you're on.

Name:	Into the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
island of Grenada can be seen off in the distance to the south, though it's
hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the waves
have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean rocking
the watercraft you're on.

Name:	Along the shoreline
Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea stretches out towards the horizon as one heads north away
from the main island of Grenada, whose shoreline travels west to east nearby,
its mixtures of green and brown from its lush foliage and sandy shores
contrasting heavily with one another. Irvins Bay begins to come into view as
one continues to travel eastern, while off to the west is Sauteurs Bay, where
quite a bit of boat traffic can be seen sailing into and out of the system of
piers and docks.

   The Caribbean Sea stretches out towards the horizon as one heads away from
the main island of Grenada, its mixtures of green and brown from its lush
foliage and sandy shores contrasting heavily with one another as you sail
along its coastline. Irvins Bay looms into view as one continues their journey
eastward, while off to the west is where Sauteurs Bay meets up with the
northern edge of the island.

Name:	Into the depths of the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory that can just barely be seen on the horizon when
hitting a high wave, it's safe to say you aren't very close to solid ground.

   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory that can just barely be seen on the horizon when
hitting a high wave, it's safe to say you aren't very close to solid ground.

Name:	Heading towards Irvins Bay
Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea stretches out into the wild blue yonder north of here and
away from the island of Grenada. The waves aren't too rough most of the time,
with only the occasional swell causing any noticable disturbance with the
passage of boats and ships as they maneuver their way around the ocean. Native
sea birds can be seen flying around in the sky, which tend not to stray too
far out into the open water without a good reason, so its safe to say by their
presence that your vessel is still close to land, whose coast line can be seen
a off in the distance south of here.

Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Irvins Bay looms into view as one continues their journey eastward,
while off to the west is where Sauteurs Bay meets up with the northern edge of
the island. Shallow water is a bit further to the south, beyond which it meets
up with the rocky shoreline.

Name:	Into the depths of the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory that can just barely be seen on the horizon when
hitting a high wave, it's safe to say you aren't very close to solid ground.

Name:	Along the coast of Grenada
Desc:$
   The coastline of the island of Grenada near the city of Victoria contains a
mixture of dull greys from the looming buildings and pavement which contrasts
blandly against the reflective sheen of the windows of the larger buildings
that make up a portion of the skyline, making for quite the dreary and
depressing bit of scenery. Saint Marks Bay stretches out towards the depths of
the ocean as one heads away from land, which eventually blends into the
Caribbean Sea where these island chains call themselves home.

   David Bay travels around the northern edge of the island of Grenada, which
heads towards an outcropping of land known as Laurant Point as one travels
through the waters nearby. Several sail boats and smaller fishing vessels
round the point as they head out into deeper ocean waters, with the occasional
commercial vessel dotting the seascape as well. The shoreline is easily
visible a short distance away to the south.

wild blue yonder as it opens up into the waters of the Caribbean Sea. The
waves aren't too rough most of the time, with only the occasional swell
causing any noticable disturbance with the passage of boats and ships as they
maneuver their way around the ocean. Native sea birds can be seen flying
around in the sky, which tend not to stray too far out into the open water
without a good reason, so its safe to say by their presence that your vessel
is still close to land.

Name:	Out in David Bay
Desc:$
   David Bay, northeast a ways from the city of Victoria, stretches out into
the wild blue yonder as it opens up into the waters of the Caribbean Sea. The
waves aren't too rough most of the time, with only the occasional swell
causing any noticable disturbance with the passage of boats and ships as they
maneuver their way around the ocean. Native sea birds can be seen flying
around in the sky, which tend not to stray too far out into the open water
without a good reason, so its safe to say by their presence that your vessel
is still close to land.

Name:	Near a trawling fleet in the bay
Desc:$
   A fleet of fishing vessels have all but effectively blockaded the way west
through Saint Mark Bay and around the island, just northwest from the city of
Victoria nearby. Several dozen vessels with trawler nets and lines cast out
make for a near impossible passage, since not only would their ropes tangle up
and damage any propeller driven watercraft, the sheer number of them
attempting to get in on the action has created a quagmire that isn't easily
bypassed.

Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
island of Grenada can be seen off in the distance to the south, though it's
hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the waves
have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean rocking
the watercraft you're on.

Name:	Into the depths of the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory that can just barely be seen on the horizon when
hitting a high wave, it's safe to say you aren't very close to solid ground.

Name:	Into the depths of the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory that can just barely be seen on the horizon when
hitting a high wave, it's safe to say you aren't very close to solid ground.

Name:	Along the coast of Irvins Bay
Desc:$
   The motion of the ocean becomes a little rougher as waves churn and lap up
against the shoreline, creating a bit of rough sailing thanks to a matching
riptide beneath the waters. The shoreline itself has become rocky with
outcroppings jutting out to absorb the constant abuse of the ocean as it
crashes down upon it, the sandy beaches found in other places around the
coastline seem to be missing from this stretch.

Name:	Nearing Bedford Point
Desc:$
   The northeastern most point of the island of Grenada, Bedford Point, comes
into view off to the southwest, and once a vessel passes it, they're at the
mercy of the open sea as the blue depths of the Caribbean stretches out before
them. Sea birds can be seen soaring overhead as they cross between their
nesting areas on the main island, as well as some of the smaller island chains
that dot the northeastern portion of the sea nearby.

Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory which is a dot one can just barely see on the
horizon when hitting a high wave, so it's safe to say you aren't very close to
solid ground.

   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
occasional small island can be seen off in the distance to the south, though
it's hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the
waves have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean
rocking the watercraft you're on.

Name:	Cruising through the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   The Caribbean Sea spans out into the horizon and beyond, with the number of
watercraft dotting the seascape dwindling the further out one travels into the
ocean. Only an occasional sea bird can be seen swooping down through the sky
as it attempts to swipe itself a fish, another indication that these waters
are quite a bit further away from land than most are comfortable with. The
occasional small island can be seen off in the distance to the south, though
it's hard to tell exactly how far away it is at this point. The motion of the
waves have become a bit less uniform, with the occasional buck of the ocean
rocking the watercraft you're on.

   The waves of the Caribbean Sea rise and fall in a melancholy rhythm for
most of the time, though the occasional swell is sure to remind those upon
their watercraft that the ocean is a fickle mistress that needs to be paid
constant attention. The occasional glimmer of green or subdued brown and tans
appear upon the horizon, denoting the location of an island that makes its
home in these waters, though for the most part it's nothing but shades of
watery blues.

   The waves of the Caribbean Sea rise and fall in a melancholy rhythm for
most of the time, though the occasional swell is sure to remind those upon
their watercraft that the ocean is a fickle mistress that needs to be paid
constant attention. The occasional glimmer of green or subdued brown and tans
appear upon the horizon, denoting the location of an island that makes its
home in these waters.

Name:	Near an island in the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   An island in the distance comes into view nearby as the waters of the
Caribbean Sea continue to roll and roil about all around, the occasional
violent wave attempting to capsize any vessel that relaxes for even a moment.
Beneath the idyllic seascape that stretches out into the distance is a rogue
wave biding its time and waiting for its moment, which is the reason why so
many sailors since the beginning of time have learned to both respect and fear
the ocean, for good reason too.

Name:	Near an island in the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   An island in the distance comes into view nearby as the waters of the
Caribbean Sea continue to roll and roil about all around, the occasional
violent wave attempting to capsize any vessel that relaxes for even a moment.
Beneath the idyllic seascape that stretches out into the distance is a rogue
wave biding its time and waiting for its moment, which is the reason why so
many sailors since the beginning of time have learned to both respect and fear
the ocean, for good reason too.

   Abrupt breezes billow off of the water, which are sure to be of either a
great help or great hindrance to sail powered vessels as they attempt to
navigate this portion of the sea. The waves become a bit choppy, but certainly
shouldn't prove too much for any seasoned sailor who is familiar with these
waters. A mixture of blues of varying hues and shades shimmer and undulate off
in the distance, as far as the horizon, making it difficult to differentiate
any possible pieces of land that may be out there.

Name:	Near an island in the Caribbean Sea
Desc:$
   An island in the distance comes into view nearby as the waters of the
Caribbean Sea continue to roll and roil about all around, the occasional
violent wave attempting to capsize any vessel that relaxes for even a moment.
Beneath the idyllic seascape that stretches out into the distance is a rogue
wave biding its time and waiting for its moment, which is the reason why so
many sailors since the beginning of time have learned to both respect and fear
the ocean, for good reason too.

Name:	Passing between two small islands
Desc:$
   This spacious sea passage opens up between two small islands along its
northern and southern sides, both shores of them visible from this vantage
point. The northern island is quite green and lush, while the smaller southern
island contrasts heavily with the ocean due to its shades of dark earthy
browns and sandy tones of its shores, which is dotted more sparsely with
forested area. The waters here are a bit calmer, most likely due to them being
broken up and soothed by contact with the pieces of land that poke up from
their depths.

   This small dot of an island contrasts heavily with the ocean due to its
shades of dark earthy browns and sandy tones of its shores, which is dotted
more sparsely with forested area. Its shoreline is fully of jagged rocks from
the constantly pounding of the waves as they crash against it, breaking off
pieces and dashing them into the depths of the sea, reclaiming it piece by
tiny piece. There doesn't seem to be any place to dock a boat, so it appears
if anyone is going to reach the island, they'll have to drop anchor and swim
the short distance to its shores.

Name:	Near a small island
Desc:$
   This small dot of an island contrasts heavily with the ocean due to its
shades of dark earthy browns and sandy tones of its shores, which is dotted
more sparsely with forested area. Its shoreline is fully of jagged rocks from
the constantly pounding of the waves as they crash against it, breaking off
pieces and dashing them into the depths of the sea, reclaiming it piece by
tiny piece. There doesn't seem to be any place to dock a boat, so it appears
if anyone is going to reach the island, they'll have to drop anchor and swim
the short distance to its shores.

Desc:$
   The deep blue waters of the Caribbean Sea loom ominously around you as you
head further out into the ocean, which becomes much more sparsely decorated
with the usual seafaring vessels that are in constant view near land. The
motion of the ocean has become a bit less predictable, the occasional wave
bucking the watercraft you're upon as it cuts its way through them. There
don't appear to be any sea birds visible in the sky either, and with land
becoming a distant memory which is a dot one can just barely see on the
horizon when hitting a high wave, so it's safe to say you aren't very close to
solid ground.

Name:	Circling around an island
Desc:$
   The small island nearby consists mostly of rough volcanic rock from its
formation, which the waves constantly bludgeon and crash upon, making the
shoreline rather hazardous to approach from all but the smallest of vessels.
There seem to be only a few places one could approach even if they swam, as
most are sheer, albeit short cliffs that line a good portion around the
island. The Caribbean Sea stretches off into the distance away from the sliver
of land, reaching off to the horizon and beyond.

shoreline rather hazardous to approach from all but the smallest of vessels.
There seem to be only a few places one could approach even if they swam, as
most are sheer, albeit short cliffs that line a good portion around the
island. The Caribbean Sea stretches off into the distance away from the sliver
of land, reaching off to the horizon and beyond.

Name:	Between two islands
Desc:$
   This spacious sea passage opens up between two small islands along its
northern and southern sides, both shores of them visible from this vantage
point. Both islands seem quite green and lush, their coastlines dotted with
various sized stretches of beach front. The waters here are rather calm, most
likely due to the proximity to the pieces of land, which undoubtedly block
this slender channel from most of the waves, making it smooth sailing all
around.

   A large island looms on the horizon, its coastline dotted with beautiful
beaches and tropical forests, creating an idyllic scenery in the center of the
Caribbean Sea. It appears to be the largest of the chain of islands in this
part of the ocean near Grenada, and it certainly is the most breath taking as
far as the view goes, seemingly untouched by modern civilization. The waves
are smooth and gentle, especially in comparison to other areas.

Desc:$
   While it may be the high ground here, it isn't particularly high at all.
The edges of the coast below are fraught with rocky crags and drop offs into
the waters beneath, making it near impossible of a climb up or down its jagged
and slick face. One can take in all the glory of this small little patch of
land from this vantage point, which isn't very much at all. The Caribbean Sea
stretches out into its vastness upon the horizon, with the occasional dot of
land along it to signify another small island, a few of which are off to the
northwest, while another even smaller dot is off to the southeast in the
distance.

   The lower portion of this small sliver of land upon the Caribbean Sea
features a little more vegetation and growth, although not by much. The
terrain here is hard to navigate and the travel is slow going, that is, unless
you want to rush ahead and snap your ankle on one of its many slick and craggy
rock surfaces. Being injured and stranded out in the middle of the ocean seems
like a lovely prospect, doesn't it?

   The tropical forest that covers this patch of land meets up with the
Caribbean Sea that surrounds it on all sides, one of the trails leading right
up to its edge and offering quite the view of the surrounding waters.
Hopefully you brought your camera along, because the scenery is quite
astounding, though it does come with a sinking feeling of remoteness, due to
the fact that this small island is surrounded by the vast stretches of deep
blue waters of the Caribbean.

   Unless you're interested in what the heart of a tropical forest looks like,
or happen to be a botanist searching for native insects and small animals,
there isn't much to be seen upon this now abandoned patch of island in the
middle of the Caribbean Sea. Granted, the scenery here is superb, and one
could easily become lost in its splendor, though it may come at quite the cost
considering the remoteness of this area.

   Several services trails have been cut into the dense tropical forest that
covers almost the entire island, branching out in different directions as they
attempt to weave their way through the thicket of greenery and foliage. The
occasional sign, though obstructed by said foliage, can be found posted along
the trail, indicating which trail leads where. A small beach front appears to
be off to the west of here, while a few signs for an old abandoned tourist
attraction can be found posted on the southern side.

   This piece of land in the middle of the Caribbean Sea, better known as
Sugar Loaf Island, takes its name from the fact that it used to be vibrant
provider of sugar, which was produced into sugar loafs before being shipped
out, which were crafted into large cones. An old facility off to the east here
still remains a tourist attraction, but it has long since stopped providing
its services, especially in this day and age when cheap synthetic alternatives
can turn a dime much quicker and easier.

   This old warehouse is filled with antique machinery that was once used in
the process of turning dark molasses-rich raw sugar, which was imported in
from sugar cane growing regions nearby in the Caribbean, and refined into
white sugar. Most of the machinery has seen better days, though it has been
kept in somewhat decent condition since its still useful as a tourist
attraction, but by no means appears as if it could function any more. There
are various signs with information posted next to some of the pieces of
machinery, explaining their purpose and when they were created for information
seeking visitors to the island.

Name:	On Green Island
Desc:$
   This place certainly lives up to its namesake, because the traveling is
quite tough with this thick tropical forest attempting to stifle any progress
on foot, even if you're using the game trails to pass through it. The sounds
of wildlife echo through the trees and foliage all around, the forest around
you seemingly alive with activity, though most of the inhabitants are quite
wary of visitors and prefer to keep out of sight when approached. Hopefully
you brought a machete, because it's certainly going to come in handy trying to
navigate around this small island.

Name:	Around Green Island
Desc:$
   The game trails here become almost impassable due to how thick and
overgrown the foliage is around them, which have attempted to all buy swallow
up and engulf what few meters of the island it hasn't already reclaimed.
Insects constantly buzz and chirp around travelers as they make their way
along the trails, along with the occasional growl from one of the smaller
mammals that make their home here before darting off into the thick
underbrush. Aren't there snakes here too..? Better be careful where you step,
in that case.

Name:	Trekking through the tropical forest
Desc:$
   The interior of this small island is thick with lush tropical forest and
seems almost impassable by any means other than on foot, and while the piece
of land it grows upon may be small, it seems much larger considering how long
it takes to navigate through all the underbrush. There isn't much in the way
of any landmarks that would give any adventurers through the forest interior a
way to let them know which direction they're headed, or even if they're headed
around in circles, which seems to happen quite often. There are no game trails
to be seen, which makes the venture that much more difficult.

Desc:$
   The lush tropical forest thins out only slightly as a rocky crag of a cliff
face juts up from the earth and reaches skyward, the top of which appears to
reach up above the heavy canopy of trees and foliage. The face of the cliff
itself is slick with moss and condensation from the humid enviroment upon the
island, which makes attempting to climb it quite dangerous if you're not
properly equipped to deal with such a venture. The occasional beam of
^Ysunlight^N cuts through the branches above and falls upon the rocky surface,
giving climbers hope that at least those few places are dry and worth using as
hand and foot holds.

Name:	Atop a cliff
Desc:$
   This doesn't appear to be the very top of the cliff, and instead, there is
a large portion that juts out from the peak and flattens slightly to offer a
somewhat level space. At the far end of the clearing is an overhang that
creates a cave, which is quite large, although it doesn't appear to be
extremely deep. A break in the canopy allows some access to the air, and there
is plenty of space to land even a helicopter or thunderbird, though it would
probably prove to be quite a rough ride in the process. Half hidden amongst
the rocky crags appear to be various types of animal bones and skulls, some of
them quite large, but as to how they happened to get all the way up here is
quite a mystery... Or is it?
