cultural beliefs that no doubt run riot around here.

Name:	Security Point
Desc:$
   You come to a second security point, with much the same identification
devices you saw back there, only these ones look a lot more expensive and
high-tech.

Name:	Guard Post
Desc:$
   The room stinks of old coffee, and save for the desk with a monitor and
microphone, there is very little furniture. A thin table sits in the center of
the room, and the window looks down into the lit hallway.

   As you rush through the hallway, it approaches a huge set of double doors
up ahead, intricately carved and fastened to the cavern walls. The hallway
begins to darken.

Name:	The Entrance
Desc:$
   The double doors reach high up to the ceiling, every single inch of them
carved with an intricate scene of sacrifice, between animals and people. Two
massive golden rings hang midway down on the doors, and lower down, a smaller
man-sized doorway appears to lead the way through. With one last glance at the
entrance before going in, you notice something with slight dread. There are
insects sacrificing people on the carving.

Name:	The Joker's Den
Desc:$
   Your feet step out of the sandy bank from the hallway, onto cold, dark
pavestone. Checking above immediately, you see the vast ceiling is populated
only by uncountable numbers of stalactites and a few candle chandleliers at
the far end. Your gaze shifts down to head-level, to scan the entire place.
The room is cleared out save for four pillars that stand in the middle of the
room, alienating the empty space elsewhere. Inside the four pillars, is a huge
marble altar, covered with a purple velvet drape. Two candles stand on each
side of the altar, and between them, absolutely silent, hovers a blue and
white spirit.

Name:	Lower Hull
Desc:$
   You step out of the mail tube, and find yourself next to a sign that reads
"^RLower Hull^n." Two out of the four lamps work properly, flickering light at
regular intervals over what appears to be a cleared hull, with specifically
ordered corners. Further on ahead of you, three doors stand firmly shut, but
with an electronic panel beside each one. Strange on an abandoned ship.

   The room is totally quiet and airtight, so hopefully it'll only hold you
here for under a minute. A red siren rings out quietly as the chamber's
computer depressurizes your body, preparing it for some unknown descent
deeper.

   Racks of various controls hang above you, although you get the feeling this
yellow can is driving without you. The water outside slowly churns from its
distinct rusty brown to a deep, dark green as you plunge deeper. The sub
begins to slow down as you approach an unseen source of light.
