Name:	East Anselm Street
Desc:$
   Anselm begins just west of here, the beginning of the eastern stretch into
a more commercial and cleaner section of Tacoma.  A few towers stand just
east, new architecture, testimonies to the corporate power, including the Ares
owned Knight building, the center of Ares Macrotechnology's operations in the
Seattle-Tacoma Metroplex.  The traffic is thick here, in close proximity to
the Interstate, that crosses under Anselm to the east.

Name:	East Anselm, west end of I-5 overpass
Desc:$
   The real border between West Tacoma's residential, low density commercial
and blight-ridden industrial districts is the I-5, with the Anselm overpass as
the bridge between them.  This area is hotly contested over between the Brain
Eaters gang and the Tacoma Rovers gang.  The graffiti on the cement walls
alongside the overpass attest to that, with tags crossing out other tags, over
a thick gray colored paint, where the city has tried, with no success to cover
up graffiti over and over again.

Name:	East Anselm St, over Interstate 5
Desc:$
   You are on an overpass, with two well maintained sidewalks on each side, as
well as a steel mesh wall to keep people from falling over.  It doesn't stop
the gangers from throwing each other off the freeway though, when driven to do
such by gang warfare.  The well maintained plasticrete and gray paint, and the
clean roads are contrasted by the obvious fresh blood stains and shell casings
from a recent skirmish between the Rovers and Brain Eaters.

Desc:$
   The main route carrying traffic from the northernmost parts of Seattle to
the gates of Tir Tairngire and beyond is accessible via an onramp leading to
the southwest.  To the east, a collection of closely situated skyscrapers make
up the core of the clean corporate zoned section of Tacoma.  Downtown Seattle
it is not, but it is not to be scoffed at either, with Knight Tower, Ares
Macrotechnology's central office for the Seattle area, located here.

Tacoma, almost a completely different world from the clean corporate feel of
East Tacoma.  Eastwards, Anselm runs through a grid of streets through the
core of the corporate sector, running right between the two tallest buildings
in Tacoma, Knight Center and Yamatetsu SeaTac Plaza.  Just to the east is
Moreland Way.

Desc:$
   Moreland Way runs north to south across the western edge of the corporate
sector of Tacoma.  Probably the least patrolled region of East Tacoma, Brain
Eaters ganger graffiti is not an uncommon sight.  On the west side, stores
with services of little interest to a shadowrunner line the street, while to
the east are tall corporate structures, highrises of a few stories high.  To
the east are skyscrapers, several blocks away, tall ultramodern corporate
complexes belonging to Yametetsu, and Ares Macrotechnology.

over the rest of Tacoma.  A wall on the east side of the road has been pelted
with black and white graffiti, with red spots, a chaotic mishmash of tag-style
lettering.  Patches of graffiti have been painted over time and time again,
only to find new and old vandals to place new and new versions of old
graffiti.

   Bridgeport is the Coffee Shop sector of East Tacoma, home to some of the
first of the Starbucks chain's franchises.  One of them still exists, as well
as a Hard Rock Cafe, a few blocks east just before Knight Center.  Looking
down Bridgeport, the Knight Center building's north face stares you down,
casting a shadow over everything on this side of the east sector.  On the west
side of Moreland is a sound wall, erected to deflect traffic noise from the
Interstate just beyond the wall.  The sound wall is covered with graffiti, and
splotches of paint used to cover the graffiti.

   Bridgeport Avenue is lined with coffee houses, frequented by the
professionals working in this sector.  It runs east to west through the heart
of the northern part of East Tacoma.  To the east, two blocks, is the north
face of Knight Center, a pinnacle of corporate presence in not just Tacoma,
but the whole Seattle Metroplex.  The street is a simple two lane street, with
traffic allowed in both directions.  Occasionally it gets backed up, but
usually the traffic is fluid.  This street is also heavily patrolled by Lone
Star Security Services, so it might be wise to keep your things put away.

trideo images playing, red and white lights from the cars, cabs, busses, and
motorcycles running down this main drag at all hours.

Tacoma, a stretch of street running between the Proteus A.G. skyscraper, and
the United Oil building.  It is not uncommon to see someone beat down by cops
because they looked like they might have tried illegal stims some time in
their lifetime.  The paranoia is thick here, and sirens can be heard
frequently, as patrol cars run down the road.  There is a lot of money in this
part of Tacoma, and the rent-a-cops are paid quite well to protect it.

infamous United Oil.  Southeast of here is the grandiose in magnitude Knight

Anselm Street.  To the north and south are lesser, but still quite large
high-rises and skyscrapers belonging to less-than-mega corporations, or
subsidiaries of megacorporations.

   On the north side of the massive Knight Center, one might feel that they
are standing by the foot of Ares, the mythical God of War.  In fact, that's
the impression that Knight Center is designed to convey, being Ares
Macrotechnology's main headquarters for the Seattle/Tacoma Metroplex.  It is
quite tall, and casts a huge shadow over you, and most of everything north of
you.  Knight-Errant's cream of the crop crack troopers secure the inside, and
secure it well, with access to the best arms and cybernetics that money can
buy.  Wageslaves hustle and bustle in and out of the Center, as well as
Knight-Errant guards who have received their assignments and are in transit to
them, or are coming to receive their assignments.

Name:	East Anselm Street, at Knight Center
Desc:$
   Knight Center stands, illustriously designed, by the most adept of
architects.  It is massive, yet has a sort of glow, with a Parthenon motif
over its front entrance.  Northwards, towards its entrance, you can see a huge
statue atop a massive fountain, wielding a broadsword and dressed like the
Spartans of old, with the build of a god.  The logo at the bottom of the
fountain, in a gold and orichalcum plated sign, reads simply, "^RAres^n". Anselm
Street's east side runs east to west through here, westward towards Old Town
Tacoma and West Tacoma, eastwards past the Yamatetsu SeaTac Plaza, and a
grouping of high-rises.  The traffic here is thick but constant, at all hours,
and there is a center divider between the two sets of two lanes, with trees
planted in the green middle.

Name:	East Anselm Street at Parker Boulevard
Desc:$
   This intersection is the heart of East Tacoma, in every direction are the
corporate goliaths, neomodern skyscrapers that look like they will virtually
tear a hole in the sky.  Northwest of here, is the Ares Macrotechnology Knight
Center complex, and southeast of here is the Yamatetsu SeaTac Plaza, not so
much illustriously named, as it is designed, the only tower in East Tacoma
that rivals the Knight Center complex.  The traffic is heavy, not just on
wheels, but on foot as well, and seems to almost rub against gridlock status.
The GridGuide systems are taxed, but well programmed.

   East of here, Bridgeport passes through a cosmopolitan set of coffehouses,
including the Starbucks Lounge, the remnant of the once great Starbucks
corporation that put a coffee shop on every corner in the 1990's to the
2010's.  Southwards, Parker Boulevard bypasses the east side of the Knight
Center, then continues past the Yamatetsu SeaTac Plaza.  Westwards, the avenue
runs between the Proteus A.G. building and the United Oil building, two names
that create nightmares in the minds of shadowrunners.

Name:	Parker Boulevard, between Zurich Multibank and Knight Center
Desc:$
   Knight Center, on the west side of the street is massive, yet graceful in a
greco-romanesque sort of way, climbing up to the sky, with pillared balconies
facing the east and west.  Its white marble-style coverings make for quite a
sight.  Zurich Multibank Systems has a modest highrise on the east side of the
street, not to be confused with Zurich Orbital's banking conglomerate, they
design matrix-based banking systems instead.  To the south is the intersection
with East Anselm Street, and to the north, Bridgeport Avenue.

Center across the Anselm and Parker intersection east of here, stands, steel
and glass with neon trim, Yamatetsu's corporate headquarters for the Seattle
Metroplex, and one of the great pillars of corporate power on the Tacoma
skyline.  A fountain, crafted with steel, bubbles water, splashing gallantly
to the bottom.  Looking inward, you can see heavily armored guards who are
assigned to keep the corporate order.  Westwards, Anselm passes through a
dense corporate sector, and eastwards, it ends a few blocks past at some high
rise buildings.

Desc:$
   Rockefeller Street criss-crosses with East Anselm, running from north to
south as Anselm runs from east to west through the heart of the corporate
sector of Tacoma.  Tall corporate skyscrapers make the biggest man feel
insect-like in stature, goliaths of steel and neon.  The streets are laden
with traffic, moving at a speed constant, but always seemingly on the brink of
gridlock.  A stoplight is here, with GridGuide systems in place to time the
lights in an efficient manner.  Above the stoplight apparatus overhanging each
street, is an array of sensors and cameras, used by Lone Star to monitor for
infractions, an automated means of enforcing traffic laws.

Desc:$
   Bridgeport runs from east to west here, westward towards the sound wall
that separates East Tacoma from Interstate 5, and eastward to the end of
Tacoma.  This block of Bridgeport is popular with the corporate "avant garde"
(read: yuppies), with the Starbucks Lounge, the very remnant of the
franchising empire of the 1990's to 2010's.  Still, its a good place to get a
hot cup of coffee, and their gimmick, a good one, is selling ^Wreal^n coffee made
with ^Wreal^n beans.  But you're going to pay a heavy cred for it.

Desc:$
   A major intersection in East Tacoma, with an array of stoplights, metered
with a semi-autonomous knowbot program integral to the Grid-Guide system.
Surrounding you are high rises and skyscrapers, monuments of corporate power
and greed.  To the west, the Knight Center stands tall, overshadowing every
other building in the East Tacoma area, including, just barely, the Yamatetsu
SeaTac Plaza south down Rockefeller.  Farther east, Tacoma comes to an end at
a lower level of office buildings, mostly filled with startup minor corps and
server farms.  Traffic is thick here, and always seems like it is at the brink
of gridlock, but never reaches it.

Yamatetsu megacorporate conglomerate.  Traffic is thick, yet fluid, and neon

services.  Motion trideo signs are propped above the street, advertising
services and goods of all varieties, from corporate security guards, to
softcore pornographic simsense.

past the Proteus and United Oil buildings, ending far west at Interstate 5's

will have their cars parked at a meter, trying to dodge the fees of parking in
the high security parking garages, in favor of the cheap cut-rate parking
meters.

land of the future bought-out-by-the-big-tens.  East Anselm Street intersects

Name:	Bridgeport Avenue
Desc:$
   Right here, and westwards is the Coffee Shop District, a place for the
corporate "avant-garde" (read: yuppies) to hang out, and sip their coffees and
think themselves elite and intellectual as they discuss philosophy and
politics over a real latte.  Eastwards, Tacoma becomes drab, and reminiscent
of West Tacoma, as block shaped office buildings full of no-names, has-beens,
and wanna-be corporations set up shop.  The only thing to remind one that its
not some commerce section of West Side are the parking meters, and the parked
cars belonging to the suits who work west of here.  Behind the office building
directly north is a sound wall, separating East Tacoma from the 405 freeway.

   Moreland Way runs north to south along the western edge of the corporate
side of Tacoma.  On the east side of the street are a set of black brick
office buildings, with black marble layers plastered to the bricks, creating a
glossy "Darth Vader Armor" effect.  Two K-E guards stand in front of the
building, stationed to 'deter vandalism'.  The wall on the west side of the
street is heavily covered by graffiti, red, white and black colors of the
Brain Eaters gang.  Over the wall is Interstate 5.

   Bremerton is a high traffic street, four lanes in girth, with a center
divider landscaped with trees in the center.  It cuts eastward, a canyon below
skyscrapers and high-rises, through stoplights and sporadic gridlock.  To the
west, Bremerton abruptly ends at a sound wall erected to deflect freeway noise
from the city you stand in.  This area is also tightly secured by crack Lone
Star troopers, paid much to keep this place free from the scum and villainy of
blue collar criminals, while ignoring and protecting the white collar
criminals in the upper levels of the towers overhead.

   Bremerton Avenue is a major street in East Tacoma, running east to west,
ending a block westward at the I-5 sound deflection wall, and eastwards at the
very far edge of Tacoma.  It cuts through a canyon of skyscrapers and
highrises, a corporate jungle of plasticrete, steel, neon, and red tape.
Crossing with Bremerton is Cleary Avenue, a moderately dense traffic street
two lanes in width.  Parking meters are lined up on the sidewalks of each
street, many of which with cars parked next to them.

heavily patrolled, with Lone Star's crack police forces, not their usual
coffee-and-donuts beat cops.  The traffic is thick on this two lane street,
with one lane for traffic in each direction.  East Anselm is to the north, and
Bremerton Avenue is to the south.  To the distant north, Cleary ends at a
parking garage, and to the south, Cleary ends at a collection of corporate
research buildings.  The street is lined with neon signs, advertising
corporate services of all sorts, from budget storage space to housecleaning.

Anselm, on the east side of the street is the eastern face of Knight Center,
the headquarters for Ares Macrotechnology's business in the Pacific Northwest.
On the west side of the street, north of Anselm is the United Oil building, a
disturbingly ominous black plasticrete and black tinted glass building that
creates a dark shadow over Tacoma.

two lanes going west, with a center divider landscaped with trees growing,
separating the lanes. Neon signs adorn the sides of the high-rises on both
sides of the street, advertising various services and products, and the
storefronts on the bottom levels of these high-rises. There seems to be a path
leading to the parking lot outfront a facility to the north. The sidewalks are
a brick-red color plasticrete, with patterns for traction etched into them.
The patterns change every few streets or so, creating dazzling sights even to
those who walk facing downward.

heart of the corporate sector of East Tacoma.

Name:	Bremerton Avenue, at Allen Street
Desc:$
   Bremerton Avenue ends here, with a large yellow and black sign that reads
"END" just before turning into a tennis court.  To the south, a small quiet
residential community forms, as Allen Street curves into South Tacoma way.
Graffiti on the signs of the tennis court clearly mark this as Brain Eaters
turf.  To the north, Allen Street runs along the easternmost edge of Tacoma,
past some nondescript low level corporate office buildings.

   Allen Street at this point is a mixed area, with a church on the east side
of the street, taking one third of the block, then some small offices set up
in what were once houses 50 years ago, up the block for the next two thirds.
The west side of the street is populated by prefabricated office buildings
belonging to no name and has-been corporations and startup companies, as well
as a few floors of server farms.

paint, used to cover up graffiti, and Brain Eaters gang graffiti covering up
the dark gray paint blotches.  It looks like a never-ending war between the
spray can and the paint roller.  Moreland is a plain two lane street with
office buildings on the east side of the street, the wall on the left.

   Callahan Street is the border between "Northeast" Tacoma, where zoning
shifts from corporate commercial to a mish-mash of mixed commerical and
residential zoning, and the corporate sector, where tall steel and plasticrete
skyscrapers nearly poke through the sky. A heavily trafficked street, with
very little hope for finding parking, Callahan's street sides are covered
bumper to bumper, with cars at every parking meter. An odd structure seems out
of place on the north end of the street here, which is sure to catch the eye
of any passerby, which seems to have an outer construction made out of a
brownish, sandstone looking material. Whatever it is, it seems to be very
popular with the locals.

Callahan continues to act as the boundary between the corporate sector and the

goalposts on each side.  On the west side, past the four houses and the
driveway to the apartment complex, is a small single level office building,
holding small companies that nobody ever heard of, and a dentist's office.  To
the north, you see a field of basketball courts separating here and the I-5

practicing, or playing a game between the two sets of bleachers.  Contrast.
And a high traffic, but narrow street creating the line between the two

   Parker Boulevard is a large street, four lanes across, and sees a lot of
traffic, being one of the two streets in the busiest intersection in Tacoma,
Parker and Anselm, two blocks south of here.  To the south, Parker runs
between Knight Center, home of Ares Macrotechnology, and a banking electronics
company whose hardware is in most banking machines in North America and
Europe.  On the west side of the street is a highrise, mostly full of offices
belonging to large companies below the megacorporate mark, and on the east
side of the street is the Parker Center, a small shopping center with
equipment aimed at corporate customers.

Desc:$
   At a "T" intersection, Callahan, stretching west to the western edge of
East Tacoma by the I-5 sound wall, runs into Rockefeller Street, running north
to south parallel to the I-405 sound wall.  North of here is a modest
residential neighborhood in close proximity to Renton, and south is a dense
business district.

Name:	Callahan Street
Desc:$
   Callahan Street is the border between Northeast Tacoma, a busy yet modest
residential/light commercial neighborhood, and the densely situated
skyscrapers and high-rises of East Tacoma.  An apartment complex, covered in
ganger graffiti, and filled with working class and lower class tenants.  The
skyline reaches up like a wall to the south, tall corporate ziggurats of power
and money stretching into the sky.  The air smells of smog and the aroma of
the polluted bogs not far from here.

   Parker Boulevard is one of two streets that run the whole gambit from north
to south through East Tacoma.  In this part of the stretch, track houses
dominate the landscape, duplexes and triplexes of family-sized living quarters
with SUV's and commuter cars in the driveways.  Trees are planted in the front
yards, as well as liberally sized lawns.  To the south, goliaths of corporate
architecture stand tall, with Knight Center and Yametetsu Plaza farther down
the boulevard.

some of the oldest houses built on it.  It runs east to west, through the
duration of Northeast Tacoma, from Dunkelzahn Memorial High School to the west
to the sound wall for Interstate 405 to the east, at Rockefeller Street.  The
street boasts nice lawns, trees along the sidewalks, and Victorian Era houses
that have been kept well over the centuries to date, adding to the general
charm of this stretch of road.

   Donnelly Street runs through a medium density residential neighborhood
here, with a mish mash of architectures, two track house styled houses on the
west corner, a couple Victorian style houses across the street from it, and
one or two small apartment complexes.  The walls of the apartment complexes
see graffiti painted on them with regularity, and the managers seem to fight
it off with blotches of off-color paint, with some success, and much failure.
To the east a stoplight goes from red to green, and traffic moves on through.

on average moderate to low, as any non local traffic has found its way to one
of the freeways by now.  The sidewalk beside the sound wall is lined with
trees, but that doesn't cover up the graffiti all over the walls.

level squalor.  On the north side of the street is a dark misty bar with an
ork passed out by the entryway and south sides of the street are huge
tenemants covered in the Death Dealers graffiti that is so common to this part
of Tacoma. Loud music blasts through the windows, and it is a common sight to
see gangers fighting each other or some schmuck who was wearing the wrong
color t-shirt while walking down this block.  The Star are called to this
block regularly, and regret coming here every time.  An AA security rating has
not improved this neighborhood in the slightest.

belching out smoke, industry in action.  To the south, you see some
residential neighborhoods, leading into the corporate sector, with its
magnificent architecture, specifically the Knight Center and Yametetsu Plaza.

Name:	Parker Boulevard
Desc:$
    Parker Boulevard runs through a modest neighborhood, not rich, not poor,
with plain track house style duplexes on each side of the street and a
commuter car in each driveway.  Continuing southwards, Parker Boulevard cuts
in between Knight Center and Yametetsu Plaza, the two largest sights on the
Tacoma skyline.

   On the east side, is a sound wall, separating you from Interstate 405,
which leads up to I-90, Bellevue, and eventually Everett where it meets with
I-5.  On the west side of the street are several broken down houses,
abandoned, with yellow tape on them that reads, "^YCONDEMNED^n" repeatedly, and a
vacant lot.

#1599
Name:	Parker Center Garage
Desc:$
   An overhang covers the parking lot for Parker Center, protecting cars from
the near-constant rain and weather in the Tacoma area. Spaces are set at even
intervals for regular sized cars and compacts, with a truck parking area near
the loading area. Businessmen, women, and wage slaves walk about, to purchase
goods for their offices, or to pick up a snack in one of the fast food venues
here. There also seems to be a few vehicle depots set up for those with nuyen
to spare, dealing with the newest and latest model vehicles, as well as
drones, on the market today. The area is well lit, with fluorescent lighting
up above.
