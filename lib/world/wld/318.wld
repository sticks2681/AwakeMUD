Name:	The Canyon Road
Desc:$
   Looking ahead at the town square, large amounts of people push and shove in
and out of it. Beaverton town square is where many shoppers go and buy gifts,
decorations and toys. Yet it is also the hangout for druggies and criminals. A
Lone Star motorcycle cop speeds behind you, chasing after a elf with a load of
money beneath his arm.

Desc:$
   The chattering and talking of people just grew to such a throb that you
feel surrounded. You see a fountain of a naked man and woman in the center of
the square, just above the gate. Many shops and stands are scattered about in
a neat little square shapped area.

Name:	The town square exit, just off The Canyon Road
Desc:$
    The tall gates of the town square are opened. Looking inside you see
nothing much more than a hoard of people wandering around, and buying a vast
amount of goods. Birds feed on bread crumbs and cereal. Little dogs run around
in circles, chasing one another. The smell of freshly cooked bread and doughs
enlighten the air with a luscious scent.  The Canyon Road continues endlessly
to the east.

   This wide road, is filled with traffic, all four lanes of it.  Off to the
north you can see cars backed up for a block or so.  To the northwest you see
a large building covered in black mirrored glass.  To the northeast you see a
smaller building which is only two stories high.  The road here continues to
the north and south or you can head north into the mound of traffic that
awaits you.
