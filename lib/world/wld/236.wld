Name:	An Underground Alcove
Desc:$
   You stand in a cavernous room, obviously once the basement of the abandoned
police station above. It has been renovated into some sort of communal house.
Curtains partition off several alcoves. North,  pillows and a small fire make
up an alter with a Wolf's head carved from sandelwood centerd on it.  South,
the entire wall is filled with a massive bookshelf, stacked from floor to
ceiling with ancient texts  and dusty tomes.  East, three smaller alcoves are
recessed into the wall. The first is piled with weapons,  armor and clips. A
hugh water bed with a blue bong sitting next to it takes up its center. Next,
a clean  spartan room, with a rack set against it's far wall holds a
Wakizashi, there is room for a Katana but it is  currently missing. A monitor
displays a small court yard, Faust's secret dojo. The last is filled with a
troll  size bed and Lazyboy recliner. A trivid is playing the Discovery
Channel. A hugh cooler next to the chair  reads "Dahamma's Beerz, Keap Out".
You recognize those names, this is the HQ of the ^W*Shad^wowsai^LntS*^N!

Name:	In the Shrubs
Desc:$
   This area is covered thickly in shrubs and plants of all sorts. Dead leaves
litter the ground, garbage is tossed carelessly about, and... Wait. Garbage?
It seems a bit strange that so much made it back this far into the thick of
the bushes. Empty booze bottles, food wrappers, and all other variety of junk
is strown about the plant life. Walking in this place also feels, different,
somehow. The ground does not quite feel the same, but much more solid than the
dirt path from before. Trees heavily block the sunlight, and their roots seem
to avoid the center of this area.

Upon very close inspection, this portion of the ground does not seem to be
ground at all. A covering of dirt overlaps a metal plate, which has very
deceiving fake plants 'growing' from it. It seems locked shut, but it's hard
to tell from where.

Desc:$
   This is the start of an underground hallway, heading south. The concrete
walls are cracked and worn, with periodic blood stains covering them. Small
patches of moss grow here and there, and the hallway is lit by a row of light
traveling the length of its ceiling. The somewhat dirty ground is littered
occasionally with empty bottles and wrappers... Along with a couple empty
syringes every now and then. Spent bullet casings are shoved away against the
sides of the wall, and the air has the faint, but still unpleasant aroma of
people not showering for quite some time.

   The fairly messy hallway continues on it's way, but this time it branches
off to the west. Lockers lining the wall of the room can be glimpsed under a
flickering, damaged light. Down the hall, the lights seem to become
increasingly unkept. Some are dim, others flicker faintly. A nearly haunting
hum of the damaged lights and the whir of some form of machinery add a gloomy
touch to an already eery atmosphere.

Desc:$
   A faint buzzing can be heard in this room as it's single light flickers
violently, creating a near strobe light effect. Dirty clothes are tossed about
the room, and through the flashing light you can see a makeshift bulletin
board sitting between two sets of lockers that wrap around this rectangular
room. Most of the messages are torn apart or smudged beyond readability, but 2
still remain that are readable. The lockers themselves are scratched and
dented, but look to have had names on them at one point. These names however,
are weathered and worn to badly to decypher. Instead, the method of
indentification has simply been replaced by written numbers in permanent
marker.

   The lights begin cutting off to a disturbing amount, barely keeping the
hallway lit enough to be seen with unaided vision. Some are broken and not
working completely, on top of an even higher frequency of dimmed and
flickering ones. A wire falls off of one of them, sparking as it twirls around
in the air like a hyperactive snake. But perhaps even more disturbing than the
decreasing amount of light is the available emplacement for a Smart-Turret to
be mounted.

remains, and the whirring sound of some kind of machine is even more audible

scittering sounds can be heard moving on the ground, but it's hard to tell
from what. The hallway comes to an abrupt end here, and takes a turn
eastwards. The air has an almost damp feeling to it.

   The corridor here is completely devoid of light, though you don't know if
that's on purpose or not. It gets substantially wider, and several crates
varying in composition from metal to rotting wood are slid against the walls-
Perfect for cover. A set of pipes portrude from the ceiling, and then follow
the length of it. A couple small water droplets can be seen leaking from the
welds in them. Some sort of small antennas are poking from random points in
the walls, perhaps a communications relay system to help with radio
transmissions in this underground lair.

walls to cover the entire area, but thankfully the wires running from them
have not yet been connected to anything. A thick metal door lies to the north,
with an incomplete maglock system on it... This place must have only recently
been constructed. The water pipes part momentarily, making room for a turret
emplacement in the center of the cracked and chipped concrete ceiling.

"Standard" and the other has "EX" printed on it. Both of which also include
heavy duty titanium construction, and near impossible maglocks.

concrete floor. The amount of crates present decreases here, and ahead lies an
imposingly open area that seems to have a disturbingly low amount of cover

   This is where the nerve racking sound of machinery was coming from. The
ceiling is much higher in here, and the water pipes from the corridors once
again show up here. They link into some sort of generator, which emits a noise
that might not be so horrific except for the already dark and grimm atmosphere
in this place. Even more worrying is how open this area is, with a lack of
cover. Only a few sparsely placed crates offer possibilities for hiding.
Corridors branch out in every direction, and by now the impression that you're
not exactly welcome here has become more than evident.

   Drifting aimlessly in an astral void all its own, is this large transparent
cube. Peering outside of this cubicle, made up of unseen forces, you see
nothing but an endless mystical ^Bs^bw^Bi^br^Bl^bi^Bn^bg^n of a ^bdark blue fog^n, against an
infinite ^Lblack backdrop^n. The serenity in the atmosphere calms you to the point
of being unable to tell if this is just a surreal reality, or a distant part
of a lost dream. Your senses seem deprived of their normal input, but are
infused by a prodigy of limitless perception. Sound emenates from all around
you, every imaginable song or noise you have heard... All blended together in
a flawless harmony, and all able to be peiced apart and heard again in their
perfect form. A perpetual silence, containing every sound known to human
comprehension, and those far beyond any reality or supernatural perception.
The real world is left behind in a shroud of unreality. Because here, time
stands still. No one leaves, and no one will.
