Name:	Entrance to Chinatown
Desc:$
   You stand at the entrance to Chinatown, in between two large buildings.
Behind you lies Tacoma, some of the noise pollution fading into this area,
along with the new noise directly ahead. You stand on the beginning of the
main road through Chinatown, "Wu Street".

Name:	Intersection of Wu and Xing Streets
Desc:$
   The sounds of bustling Chinatown draw your attention all over Wu street.
Cars are not so common here, though you do see a few, and a few motorcycles
can be seen in Triad colors zooming past on occasion. To the south is Xing
Square, home to the market. To the east is a large black brick building with
oriental designs, seeming rather ominous in a place like this, and to the west
is a large sign stating 'Massage Parlor'.

Name:	Xing Square
Desc:$
   This is Xing Square, home of the Chinatown marketplace. Ramshackle shops
line the street sides, and people browse and buy all around, speaking in
several different languages. A building to the northeast seems rather odd
here, and a sign on its side indictates "Kiriyama's". Xing Square is also the
intersection of Wu and Guang Street. You draw back a bit as a crusty old
fountain shoots an irregular burst of water in your direction. Damn, all over
your new clothes, too....

Name:	A Dark Alleyway
Desc:$
   The noise of China Town drowns out and becomes distant the further into the
alleyway you go.  The soothing sound of water forming an eddie and running
down a drain begins to cast a hypnotic spell on you.  If it weren't for that
awful smell portruding from the manhole, you might even consider curling up
next to that bum for a nice nap.

   Past a large archway, decorated in shades of red and yellow, you see a set
of double doors. Past those, the floor is littered with petals from some
flower you are unfamiliar with. The room generates a peaceful, easy feeling
that pervades your senses and relaxes you. You look over to your right at a
small counter with an Asian woman in her 40s standing behind it. She smiles at
you in an odd manner, as if she expects that you already know what kind of
place this is. You don't, but a moan from a door at the other end of the room
quickly tells you all you need to know.

Name:	Down in the sewers
Desc:$
   Well you've found your way in and out of the sewer sytem, and much to your
dismay the area is filled with, yep you guessed it, shit.  It's everywhere.
It's on the walls, on the ground, on the ceiling, and now it's on your shoes.
The smell of the sewer system is so strong you're not too sure if you'll be
able to stay down here for too long without some type of breathing apparatus.

   Oak trim lines the walls just below the ceiling of this shop, depicting
ancient carvings.  Six pillars that look like the Roman gods of old are carved
out of stone and set to look as if they are holding up the ceiling.  You stare
down at the floor and begin to feel a little motion sickness.  Comets shoot by
in a blazing fury, while stars are dotted across the flooring.  It seems as
though someone cut a chunk of the night sky out and set it into place here in
this shop's floor.

   As you cross from the street to the indoors it really feels as though
you're stepping from the city into a rain forest.  Speakers mounted in the
ceiling throughout the store play soothing nature sounds, and all sorts of
plants grow up from everywhere.  The floor is actually made out of dirt!
Stepping stones are in place for all the aisles, and seem to lead to the cash
register.  The shelves are lined with the latest in natural herbal supplements
and remedies.

crowd the road.  A wooden sign is hanging above a shop door to your north that
says, "The Botanical Garden".

   You are struck by the sparse decoration of what is either a weapons store
or a grisly trophy room. There are only a few weapons on the walls here, but
most of them didn't get the blood cleaned off of them before they were put up
for sale. You wonder how the shopkeeper came across this variety of weaponry.
In the corner, sitting on a low cabinet in the back of the shop, is an
expressionless young man who looks like he is (or was) bleeding from his eyes.
He says nothing, but simply watches as you browse. He must be the owner. Next
to him you notice what appears to be a ^Bclass picture^N from Japan.

Name:	A booth
Desc:$
   Although you can't see all the way to the street from this booth, it's
spacious none the less.  A golden buddha sits in the middle of the table,
incense burning slowly inside.  You try to flag down the waitress to place an
order, but realize she doesn't seem to go to the booths, given the
sensitive;nature of things usually being discussed there in.  You'll have to
catch her on the run if you'd like to place an order.

   A urinal is set into the wall, next to a stall that houses a toilet.
Uplifting Chinese sayings are carved into the walls imbuing the room with a
peaceful feeling. One in particular catches your eye: 'If life's successes
equal 'A', then 'X' plus 'Y' plus 'Z' equals 'A', where 'X' is hard work, 'Y'
is fun, and 'Z' is knowing when to keep your mouth shut.

For starters, the walls are spray painted with Triad colors, along with
various other pieces of graffiti. Thin paper walls that once divided rooms
have been torn to shreds, flapping slightly in the cross breeze. Someone has
gone through the trouble of spray painting across one of the walls in very
large letters, "^RALL FIREARMS PROHIBITED!^N" Oh yeah, this place is definitely a
dive chummer, no doubt about it.

   The second floor landing isn't much better off than the first, and by this
time, one has probably become quite familiar with the half-rotten wooden
boards that consist of what can barely be designated as a staircase. In fact,
it's more along the lines of stacked planks of what was once wood, but has
become heavily discoloured by the elements and various other forms of abuse,
both natural and intentional. The climb up them is probably treacherous unless
you have a degree in street urchin spelunking.

   More broken bits and shards of what was once furniture are scattered across
the floor, as if someone had a temper tantrum and decided to redecorate the

eastern wall, while the rest of the walls seem to be plastered with classy
spray painted murals, consisting of old favourites such as, "^WFor a good time
call...^N" and "^REat at Joe's!^N". One of the gangers seems to have gone through
the trouble of spray painting what could be considered a fairly nice work of
art, one that isn't even lewd or crude... But, ofcourse, some wise ass had to
go and write next to the artists name, adding on "Sucks!". Classy guys huh?

Name:	Yet another decaying staircase
Desc:$
   By now, it's pretty obvious what kind of trouble one is going to have to go
through to ascend to the next floor, and frankly, it's getting kind of old.
Couldn't these bastards have the common decency to spring for at least one
intact set of stairs? Seriously? But no, they couldn't, and instead you're
left with climbing up the equivalent of little more than rotten wooden
pallettes nailed together by the hand what could only be described as an
epileptic in mid-convulsion.

Name:	Fourth Floor of the Dojo
Desc:$
   Now atop the fourth floor landing, one can only let out a sigh of relief
after having scaled a mountain of easily broken stairs (if they can even be
called that). More of the same seems to be on the menu, and visitors are
greeted with crude depictions of sexual acts spray painted on the walls.. Or
at least you think they're sexual acts? Frankly, some of them you've never
seen, and hell, you're kind of hoping you never do. The corridor leads off to
the other portion of the fourth floor of the dojo.

Name:	Fourth Floor of the Dojo
Desc:$
   The fourth floor seems to be a bit better off than the previous levels, and
at the least, there appears to be some couches to lounge around upon. Then
again, do you really wanna test your luck? They look pretty beat up, and
probably have more diseases than your local joy girl. There was a trideo set
at one time, but someone seems to have decided they didn't enjoy the
programming offered, since they went through the trouble of smashing against
the wall until it was little more than a smattering of broken glass and
plastic. Even so, they plugged it back in, perhaps expecting it would still
work? Who knows. A heavy oak door is set off to the west, and probably appears
to be the most valuable furnishing this entire joint has.

Name:	The last endeavor.. Or not?
Desc:$
   After making it through the previous levels of the dojo, and upon reaching
the very end, one is greeted by.... Nobody..? Absolutely nothing? Isn't the
'Big Bad' supposed to be here..? Instead, there seems to be nothing of
immediate interest or worth, unless you count the sparse, shabby moth eaten
furnishings and a few cobwebs stacked up in the corners. Then what the hell
was the purpose of this dojo? Man.. Talk about disappointment. Also, if you
don't get the Game of Death reference, sucks to be you.

Name:	Rita's Body Sculpture
Desc:$
   You are inside Rita's Body Sculpture shop, and true to the name there are
pieces of artificial flesh ready to be grafted onto a willing patient. The
room has a sterile feel and smell to it, not uncommon to upscale shops and
hospitals like this. The doctor, Rita, is busy examining specimens underneath
a microscope when you walk in.

Desc:$
   A tiny little man in a white smock is sitting behind a counter, hidden by a
massive stack of books.  You wonder if it would kill him in the event that
they fell over.  In the middle of the room is a shiny metal operating table
with a tray holding some tools.  Lining the walls are heavy duty metal
refrigerators housing the products the good doctor sells.

Name:	A Training Room
Desc:$
   This seems to be the martial arts training room of the Triad that owns this
dojo. The dark blue padded matting that covers the floor feels slightly
springy under your steps. Weapons, practice dummies and various other training
implements litter the area. A few Triad members, dressed in white training gi,
spar together; they don't seem too interested in causing trouble.
