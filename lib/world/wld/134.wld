Desc:$
   After making that nice red carpet a slight tint of brown(you didn't know
the mud on your boots wasn't dry) you find your self in the front lobby of the
restraunt. A few leather chairs are set about here, there is artwork littering
this whole room from the early 2010's. You feel very outta place here mostly
cause you lack there Chic clothing...mabey if you drag one of them out back an
let them meet your Predator II you can get some Chic clothing off them or at
least there corpse.

shadows its called, before you could never understand why...now you can.
Flowers of all the differn't night blooming plants grow here, thriving on the
shadows this room is made of. A small dark river runs through to what appears
to be a reflecting pool, at first looking like water, upon closer examination
you realize that it is really pure darkness that flows soothinly to the pool.
