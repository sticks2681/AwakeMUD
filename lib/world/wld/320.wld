Name:	A dusty road
Desc:$
   You stand along a well-used side road, old pavement giving way to hardened
and cracked dirt. Tire tracks, and even tread tracks lead to the northwest,
where a small bunker-like outpost is surrounded by a chain link fence. A small
wheat field exists on either side of the road.

NightDesc:$
   Spotlights from the northwest occasionally illuminate your position,
showing that you stand along a well-used side road with old pavement giving
way to hardened and cracked dirt. Tire tracks, and even tread tracks lead to
the northwest, where a small bunker-like outpost is surrounded by a chain link
fence. Wires above the fence seem to glow oddly...

Desc:$
   From here you can make out a few vehicles parked near the bunker to the
northwest, and a sign on the gate of the chain-link fence states, "UCAS
Territory: Trespassers May Be Shot". Monowire seems to run the length of the
fence as well, and two cameras mounted on top hone on your position. Despite
the warnings, there doesn't seem to be much activity outside or inside the
fence. To the southeast, the dusty road you stand upon continues.

NightDesc:$
   Spotlights search this area frequently, their source on top of a bunker to
the northwest. You can make out a chain-link fence with a sign stating, "UCAS
Terrotiory: Tresspassers May Be Shot". On top of the fence, a single wire
glows ominously. To the southeast a dusty road continues, and to the northwest
there is a gate in the chain fence.

Name:	At the chain link fence
Desc:$
   You stand next to a ten foot tall chain link fence, topped off with
monowire and two cameras aiming directly at you. The gate stands to your
northwest, a sign upon it stating, "UCAS Territory, Trespassers May Be Shot"
and beyond it a small square bunker with a lit door after a small corridor. A
few vehicles are parked outside, including what looks to be a defunct tank and
a couple military jeeps. To your southeast, the dusty road you stand upon
continues.

NightDesc:$
   Spotlines shine directly on you, illuminating your position. A glowing wire
runs the entire length of the fence to your northwest, the fence itself about
ten feet high. Beyond the fence, a tank sits ominously and a few military
jeeps are parked. A bunker is located farther to the northwest, a lit door
somewhat within its depths. Upon the fence gate is a sign, stating, "UCAS
Territory, Trespassers May Be Shot".

   You stand on a newly painted, paved, parking area just southeast of a
bunker, and northwest of a chain link fence topped with monowire. Located on
top of the bunker are five spotlights, and a corridor leads partially into the
bunker, ending with a door lit up by small lights. A defunct tank with broken
treads sits here, though the turret still looks operational. A few military
jeeps are parked here and there, covered in dust and mud.

Name:	Military Communication Strategics 2A
Desc:$
   You stand in a rather bland office, with a huge display monitor and other
smaller monitors surrounding it. There are plenty of computers up and running,
headsets connected to most. Tactical data is displayed on the large monitor,
and it changes relatively quickly to different areas around the globe.
Remnants of eaten lunches and other things lay strewn about. The large monitor
also has a datajack input, but seems to be inactive at the moment.

Name:	A Steel Blue Corridor
Desc:$
   This blue steel corridor runs between the 2nd MCS department and what seems
to be a large bolted door to the north. A sign above the door exclaims,
"DATASTORAGE - KEEP OUT!" Black reflective panels are located at equal
intervals in the green steel bars that run the walls. This corridor is
extremely clean and smells like fresh pine forest.

   A large, bolted, reinforced steel door lies to your north, with a sign
above - "DATASTORAGE - KEEP OUT!" There is an electronic hum from beyond the
door, and a few beeps escape occasionally as well. To the south, the MCS 2nd
Department offices are located. A black, reflective half-sphere is directly
above. This corridor smells like fresh pine forest.

   An old worn arch defines the entryway into the UCAS Adept training area.
Slash marks riddle the surface of the wall, a contrast to the smooth, cold,
blue steel corridors on this level of the facility. To the north, in the
middle of the training area, a circle seems to be painted onto the ground.
Possibly for meditation?

   Upon closer inspection, this doesn't seem to be a meditation circle at all.
It seems to be a duelling circle for advanced students. In fact, much of the
circle is splattered with blood. Used medkits lay about, gathering dust (and
blood). One white line splits the center of the circle, indicating starting
sides for the brave UCAS students, no doubt.

   This room feels much cooler than the rest of the facility, and shows no
signs of heating vents. Your breath shows as you exhale, and there actually
seems to be a few icicles forming here and there from condensation. Blue steel
walls surround you, and a black reflective half-sphere is centered on the
ceiling. All different kinds of martial weapons line the walls, from ancient
halberds, japanese katanas, to more modern combat-steel swords and monoaxes. A
desk sits near the back wall, covered in hundreds of papers and occult books,
with a comfy black leather chair behind it.

Glowing red runes line the walls, and a blood stained altar makes itself
obvious. A long dead corpse lies in the corner, a huge piece of steel from the
ceiling lodged onto its torso.

Name:	A heavily secured checkpoint
Desc:$
   Red steel bars about four feet off of the floor line the heavily fortified
concrete walls. Vents release fresh air into this deep underground level of
the UCAS base. This corridor is clean, and two menacing automated gun turrets
on swivel mounts jut out from the walls. To the south, a huge reinforced steel
door blocks the path, with a large platinum sign hanging upon it. "^YBrigadier
General Ives^N" is engraved on it in gold lettering.

Name:	Brigadier General Ives' Office
Desc:$
   You stand within a marvel of modern architecture. The room manages to
support many feet of stone, soil and other UCAS base levels, while still
having a beautifully crafted stone arch above. The east wall has a huge map of
the world upon it, and other walls sport numerous smaller maps of different
regions across the globe. A huge metal desks sits in the middle of the room,
with an enormous leather chair, and behind that a large weapons rack sits
against the south wall. Within the rack is every gun imaginable, including a
few heavily modified assault canons, and a rather out-of-place artillery shell
launcher.

   This is the area where Draneer's questing mobs are located, but sadly he
can no longer use them as his dev level isn't high enough.

   This room never ends, nor seems to begin. It is one perfect circle, and as
soon as you step in you receive vibes telling you to leave.
