Desc:$
   Plasteel windows stretch from both sides of the floor and join in the
middle of the roof providing a clear view of your surroundings. White,
cushioned seats line the middle facing towards the windows while the seats
along the sides face both front and back. Light green floors and bordered
doors add an unimaginative touch to the decor. Doors line each car on the east
and west.
