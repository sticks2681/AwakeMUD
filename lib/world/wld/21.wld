Name:	The Lobby of Club Penumbra
Desc:$
   Even here, in the lobby, it's hard to hear yourself think. The music from
further inside the club is amplified by the speakers hanging from the roof in
here. A single valet mans the cloakroom, but he seems pressed for time as he
rushes to and fro, trying to deal with the strangely large amount of patrons
for this time of day. A pair of elaborate double doors stands to the west,
allowing a view further into the club, which even during the day, still has
quite a few people in it.

   Even here, in the lobby, it's hard to hear yourself think. The music from
further inside the club is amplified by the speakers hanging from the roof in
here. A team of valets man the cloakroom, working double time to manage with
the throng of clubbers coming and going. Elaborate double doors are thrown
wide open, allowing a view further into the club. Occasionally a stray
laserlight will shine through here and out the front doors.

Desc:$
   Standing here affords a view of the entirety of the public area of Club
Penumbra. A raised area here, and to the south contains seating and tables for
people to relax and meet at. The entire club is packed to capacity, getting a
chair in this area, or the area further south would be near impossible, as
would getting out onto the dancefloor. The walls and roof sparkling with a
faux starlight, giving the impression of being outdoors.

   Even though it's the middle of the day the dancefloor is still swarming
with people. The floor is filled mostly with hardcore habitues, dancing like

   People everywhere. It's the only real way to describe the Dancefloor. It's
a mass of swarming bodies and limbs, dancing to the beat of the near defeaning
music. Even shouting your voice could not be heard. The smoke and laser show
lights up area extending up to the high ceiling above, whipping the crowd into
a frenzy. Looking down reveals the floor to be painted in a moon surface

Name:	Dancefloor by the Stage
Desc:$
   During the day the music and light shows are completely canned, and as such
the stage is not the center of attention. That doesn't mean this area is clear
though, far from it. Dancers pack the area, using all the available space to
strut their moves. The music here is deafening due to the proximity to the
massive speaker system used by the club. 
~
NightDesc:$
   The crowd is surging against the stage, trying to get as close as possible
to the DJ who stands behind his control board. He manipulates the boards with
slick precision, sending the lasers scattering around the club in elaborate
displays. The music here is deafening due to the proximity to the massive
speaker system used by the club. The sweaty bodies of the dancers make it hard
to move, not that it bothers many of the people this close to the stage.

most of them rather professional looking, like they are on a business meeting.

Name:	Southern end of the Bar
Desc:$
   During the day the staff set up stools down this end of the bar to cater
for the executive crowd who just come in for a quick drink. This area is
relatively quiet, due to the sheer amount of powerful people it attracts. That
said, people still occasionally spill down here when the northern area of the
bar gets busy.

NightDesc:$
   Through all the hustle and bustle of the rest of the club this area is
relatively quiet. Likely due to the crowd that is attracted to this section.
This is where the real movers and shakers meet, before heading into the

trying to get a drink while the north part of the bar is packed to capacity.

   At this time of night there is standing room only by the bar. The bar staff
rush back and forth trying to serve all the customers, but it is a losing

   A lot of the view to this side is blocked by the Renraku Arcology. It
stands slightly taller than the Space Needle and is easily one of the most
imposing structures in the Metroplex. Beyond the arcology it is possible to
see Council Island in the middle of Lake Washington, and the vast expanse of
the Redmond Barrens running to the foot of the Cascade Mountains.

imposing structures in the Metroplex. Off in the distance it's possible to see
the faint flicker of lights eminating from the Redmond Barrens, a stark
contrast to the tightly packed cluster of lights in Downtown and Bellevue.

   Even on cloudy days Mt. Rainer is the main focal point on this side. It's
snow cap tip standing far above the vast plains of ash easily visible below.
Closer than that planes can be spotted taking off and landing at Sea-Tac
Airport and the I-5 can be seen running towards downtown Tacoma.

NightDesc:$
   The streets below sparkle in the night, a dazzling array of colour and
movement. This is in contrast to much further south, where the northern edge
of the Puyallup Barrens is black as night. Downtown Tacoma can also be seen to
the southwest, a shining beacon across the Puget Sound.

   The view from this side extends over Puget Sound. On a clear day you can
even see the Olympic Mountains off in the distance. Look down the I-5 is
visible, their lights streaming back and forth. The lights of ships can be
seen far off into the sound, and it's possible to make out the lights on the
otherside of the Sound, in Native American territory.

   The twin glass plated skyscrapers of Mitsuhama Towers takes a large degree
of attention away from the rest of Downtown Seattle. The shipyards further
north in Everett can clearly be seen along the edge of the Puget Sound, along
with the huge Federated-Boeing complex, the largest building in the world. 
~
NightDesc:$
   The lights of downtown reflect off of the glass plated Mitsuhama Towers,
leaving it looks like a successful experiment in modern art. The lights along
the runways at the Federated-Boeing facility can be seen, along with the huge
patches of darkness marking their factories. The lights of Vancouver can be
seen further north, casting a mild glow over the horizon.
