   The walls display a plethora of earthen hues.  Browns collide hazardously
with gray, orange, and red dirt.  Wooden support braces line the walls,
keeping the ceiling from caving in.  Old utility lamps connected by a black
electrical wire run the length of the ceiling, disappearing into the bowels of
the tunnel system.

soil begins to fuse with solid rock.  Deep scars in the rock spiral

   Wooden support braces that lined both walls are replaced by one single

symmetry of the previous markings.

   Pieces of rock, undoubtedly from the walls, line the floor here.  There is
some writing carved into the walls here between two of the spiraling scars.
Rock walls begin to morph ever so slightly into black coal.  Even though
utility lights run the length of the ceiling supplying adequate lighting, the
tunnels become darker than the blackest night.

   Splinters of wood litter the tunnel way through here.  The support brace
holding the ceiling back apparently split sometime ago causing a minor
cave-in.  Dirt and rock fallen from the ceiling strive to suffocate the
tunnel.  Smaller metahumans would have no problem maneuvering the cave-in, but
larger variants might have some trouble squeezing past here.  Light assaults
the collapse from the other side, exposing imperfections in the nearly solid
half-wall.

   Sedimentary rock mingles with dark coal along the ceiling and walls.  The
floor shines like a lake of black glass.  Light reflects off of the obsidian
floor casting a unique shadow about the tunnels.  Certain areas of the floor
have become scratched and worn from use.  A black electrical line runs through
the tunnel connecting utility lamps which in-turn provides light to the
tunnels.

traveler.  The floor through here has been worn smooth from use and the
earthen walls look rather new.  Wooden support braces stand on either wall
holding back the onslaught of the earth's fury.  Light is supplied through
here by an electrical wire and utility lamps.

   The floor in this portion of the tunnels has a dull white, almost ivory
look to it.  Small pieces of obsidian have been embedded in the wall giving
off a dark ominous glow.  A black electrical wire snakes its way down the
ceiling, winding this way and that.  Wooden support braces hold the earthen
walls and ceiling in place while metal utility lamps provide light to the
tunnel.

   The way to the east is lined with geode like crystals.  The majority of the
wall here is mostly dark black coal though.  Wooden support braces line the
walls in an endless pattern all through out the tunnels, here is no different.
Utility lamps light the path in both directions connected by an electrical
wire virtually invisible against the black coal background.

   The tunnels twist and turn laboriously.  Stalactites hang low from the
ceiling in an effort to catch unsuspecting travelers off guard.  Every hundred
yards or so dirt and rock debris will be scattered everywhere, probably from a
falling stalactite.  Light is supplied throughout the area by utility lamps
hung from the ceiling. Although there is ample lighting the area seems encased
in darkness from the coal walls and ceilings.

   Piles of rock debris and lose earth collect at the edges of the floors and
walls.  Wooden splinters from shattered support braces line the tunnels.
Stalactites that once hung low from the ceiling threatening to slice open the
top of any weary travelers head have been smashed here leaving nothing but
stubs.  Broken glass and mangled metal from the utility lamps that use to
supply the area with light are scattered about.

the holes of some walls in a sporadic splash of red mingled with the earthen

   The floor casts off small heat waves throughout this portion of the tunnel.
Precipitation from the thick atmosphere begins to collect on the walls.  Water
drips down from stubs in the ceiling where stalactites used to hang.
Something large has moved through here utterly decimating the earthen
structures.  There seems to be a natural thermal duct just beneath the tunnel.

   Warm air pushes its way up from the floor seemingly from nowhere.  Black
obsidian makes up the composition of the earthen walls and has been polished
smooth by something rubbing up against it.  The black glass undoubtedly would
be a magnificent sight to behold, if not for the lack of lighting.  Broken
utility lamps litter the area.

   The stalactites hanging from the ceiling in this cavern have been carved to
look like Orks, Dwarves, and Trolls.  The faces appear to be tortured and lost
in agony, some of the stone bodies have been horribly disfigured.  The walls
are a deep auburn color accenting the lost souls.  Hot pungent air moves in
and out of the cavern, probably from a naturally occurring thermal vent.

Desc:$
   The tunnel begins to laboriously twist rerouting to the southwest.
Overhead lamps supply light to the area as the color of the wall slowly
transitions into black coal.  The wooden support braces that would normally be
brown have been smudged black from the ancient forest, now turned fossil fuel.
The tunnels slowly become devoid of all color, except for the dull yellow halo
cast off by the utility lamps, everything else is black.

   The tunnel begins to take on a stagnant smell.  All about the earth is
nothing but a black void, seemingly lost in God's consciousness.  The only
sign that there ever was life to pass through this desolate hell hole is the
utility lamp hanging from the ceiling supplying light to the surrounding area,
and the wooden support braces holding back the force of the world that
threatens to crush unsuspecting travelers.

   Black obsidian mingled with the black earthen coal gives off the appearance
of tiny eyes set into the walls.  The air is laced with the stagnant smell of
stale air.  A black electrical wire supplying power to the utility lamps
throughout this area that would normally be visible fades into non-existence
against the black coal background.  The utility lamps flicker slightly,
threatening to go out.

   The walls seethe and speak of times past as the hanging utility lamps
flicker slightly deep in the bowels of the Underground Tunnels.  A slight
draft blowing through here clears out the stagnant smell of damp earth and
causes the lamps to sway ever so slightly.  The silhouettes cast on the walls
from the stalactites look as though earthen fingers are reaching out to grab
unsuspecting travelers.  The coal black walls seem to continue on into the
depths of hell.

   The vein of black coal running through the earth seems to stop here at this
intersection.  A fine line of black earth seems to have been stenciled in

braces create the doorways into the conjoining tunnels.  Several utility lamps
have been hung from the ceiling creating an extremely well lit area.  The
intersection appears to have been dug out larger than originally intended.

   Stalactites begin to hang down low throughout these tunnels, and piles of
rock along the edges of the wall give off the impression that someone has
broken them off before.  Small streams of water trickle down the sides of
either wall and disappear into the seam wear the wall meets the floor.  This
tunnel system was probably unknowingly dug through an aquifer.

Name:	A Tunnel Intersection
Desc:$
   Several tunnels run together here forming a 'T' like intersection. One
running to the north, while another branches off in the eastern and western
directions.  Skulls carved out of obsidian shine brilliantly in the dull glow
of a hanging utility lamp.  The walls in this area are covered with dried
blood and bullet holes.

   The tunnel appears to break off in several directions.  The main service
tunnel runs to the east and west while a smaller tunnel breaks off to the
south.  Stalactites begun to form along the ceiling, while stalagmites
threaten to push their way up from the ground.  The air throughout here is
thick and stale, leaving much to be desired in the ways of breathing.

   This tunnel must've been put in the system as an after thought and dug by a
dwarf.  The walls are composed primarily of coal and the tunnel itself seems
to be devoid of any light save for a small glow to the southwest.

   The walls appear to have been polished smooth.  At one time the room was a
beautiful collage of black coal mixing hazardously with white granite, but now
seems to have become stained yellow from years of exposure to smoke.  A dense
fog of smoke hangs in the air making it nearly impossible to breathe.

   Water has begun to collect in small pools where the tunnels walls meet the
floor.  The liquid seems to be seeping through the ceiling from an aquifer
somewhere up above.  A small draft pushes its way through the tunnel clearing
out some of the thick stale air.  Wooden support braces line the walls as the
tunnels press on into the bowels of the earth.

   Jagged rocks protrude from either side of the tunnel walls, while
stalactites hang dangerously low from the ceiling, threatening to snag
unsuspecting travelers.  The sounds of muffled voices can be heard throughout
the series of tunnels surrounding this area.  The path through here has been
frequently traveled, despite the rough terrain presented by the ceiling and
walls.

   The tunnel seems to be engulfed by darkness.  White specks of light flicker
passionately along the walls, floor and ceiling, almost as if they were stars.
Blue, purple and green clouds of gas reflect light from some unknown source
spreading an array of magnificent colors into the blackness.  What appears to
be a transparent clock seems to float through the nothingness, the hands dance
across the face in a dizzying embrace that seems to depict eternity itself.

   The room is illuminated by a single candle in the center of the room.
Beyond reason, the candle itself seems to be supplying more light than the sun
itself.  The entire room is engulfed in a brilliant white light, an all
consuming force the keeps a sterile and pure atmosphere all throughout the
room.  The walls have been polished smooth and reflect only an unending
whiteness.

   Water droplets echo throughout the tunnel like the sound of a blacksmiths
hammer.  A black electrical wire snakes its way across the tunnel ceiling
supplying light to several utility lamps.  Human and meta-human skulls alike
have been carved into stalagmites protruding from the ground.  Several of the
wooden support braces have been rotted away throughout the years and have
begun to crack splinter.  The tunnel continues on to the northwest and
easterly directions.

   The rough contour of the rock begins to gradually fade into a smoother
polished surface towards the western end of the tunnel.  White light pours
into the tunnel from the opening up ahead.  Pieces of tile have been
sporadically placed becoming more uniform as the tunnel reaches towards the
western light.  The sterile smell of bleach hangs thickly in the air.

enter the small chop shop.
