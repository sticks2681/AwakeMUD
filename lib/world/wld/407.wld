   Raw material is brought into this area of the facility while industrial
machining is completed by huge fabricators. The finished parts, wings, bodies,
and mechanical components slowly move down the assembly line shepherded by the
massive Titans.

   The core of the remotely piloted F-B Commuter is begun here. Engines and
internal mechanics and devices are swiftly put in place, aligned to the
massive fabricated frame. The rapid clack-clack-clack-clack of pneumatic tools
echo off the walls. As the plane moves down the line parts of the airframe are
placed over its internal structure.

   The airframe is held in place and sealed here. Plumes of erupting plasma
fly high into the air as the Titans weld the seams on the F-B Commuters.  As
the giant aircraft move toward the south along the automated assembly line
they look almost complete.

simmers on another. It is obvious that a great deal of work and planning is
done here.

the corner of their eyes. Now and then they nod towards you snickering under
their breath. A few claugh deeply now and then pushing and shoving one
another. Laid out on the deck are dozens of cargo containers being busily
unloaded to the Federated-Boeing Renton dockyards.

Surrounding the entire compound is a 5 meter high concrete wall atop which can

   The small warehouse that is Federated-Boeing Renton Research & Development
center stands before you. A secure checkpoint composed of Elite Security
Guards and some very serious looking drones awaits. The identity of everyone
coming and going is put through a vigourous screening process before they are
cleared for entry or exit. Hope you have a plan chummer.

   This massive room is filled with scientists and engineers working on
various projects. Most of the projects involve drones of one type or another.
They appear to be small and animal like such as rabbits and squirrels, the few
nearing completion have lifelike skin and fur attached on most of their frame.

   An overwhelming buzz is heard in this room. As you look around you see
hummingbird flitting here and there in all corners of the massive warehouse
room. Scientists and engineers laugh and giggle like school girls while
clapping themselves on the back. It gives the high security and presence of
the beautiful almost magical birds a surreal quality.

   Now this is it. When you think of corporate R&D and high security this is what you want to find. Facing off on either side of the huge warehouse floor are 2 massive somewhat anthropomorphic robots similar in size to the massive giant metatype. Although of similar size, shape, and design the resemblance stops there. One look tells you these are robots, not in anyway attempting to conceal the fact. From the huge mechanical arms, to the sensor pods set atop them like heads. They circle one another as scien
tists and engineers cluster in a small control room with thick armored glasses. You cannot hear them but they appear to be giggling like little school girls. One of the robots shoots forward with blinding speed, the room shaking from the impact of its foot steps. It brings a massive sledgehammer down onto the sensor pod of the other, sparks, and the smell of burning ozone fills the room as the headless robot falls over. An intercom switches on and a nasally voice says, "FATALITY!" snorts and giggles are he
ard before the intercom switches off.

   A single solitary cell composed for reflection upon oneself and the life
one has lead.  The reinforced glass door is opaque, yet when a guard wants to
see inside, an electrical current is sent through it and the door turns
transparent.  The walls are painted white and are made of plastisteel.  There
is a steel bedshelf covered with a thin pallet coming out of one wall, a desk
and a toilet and sink in the small room, but it is devoid of everything else,
including a window.  Up above, a bright white fluorescent light is recessed
into the ceiling and sealed off by a plexiglass shield.

   This eclectic little coffeehouse is painted with garish, clashing colors.
The tiles on the floor are even mismatched.  The effect is charming shabby
chic with an affluence that is hinted at with the rich sculptures and
fountains tucked away into each sitting area.  The sitting areas are circles
of seating that varies to different tastes.  Sprawling chaise lounges butt up
against bean bag chairs and stiff wooden seats in various areas and more
besides.  A long counter laden with glass cases of all of the favorite,
assorted coffeehouse delicacies is where one would shout their order to the
hyped up baristas behind a field of steam.

Desc:$
   This huge interchange between I-405 to the east and west, south to the
junction with State Route 18 and north into Downtown Renton via Rainier Ave is
heavily forested on all sides to form a natural sound barrier.  Traffic is
almost always crawling by here and most likely there are quite a few horns to
be heard over your stereo.
