Name:	A Darkened Alleyway
Desc:$
   Tucked between two buildings and just under the I-5 overpass, this alley is
in perpetual shadow. Steam rises through a street manhole and drifts over the
soggy newspapers and rubbish that litter the wet pavement. The sounds of the
traffic on the nearby I-5 overpass echo throughout the alley. A rusty old
barrel with its contents burning sits off to the side while a few shady
looking characters huddle around it. On the eastern side of the alley, a
derelict building looms above you and appears to be an old multi-level
warehouse. The windows are yellowed and several of the panes have been broken.
The old brick that this building was made from years ago is obviously
deteriorating. A curiously new looking large steel reinforced roll-down style
garage door prevents entry.

Name:	A Decrepit Loading Dock
Desc:$
   A steep concrete ramp leads away from a massive bay door and into a large
concrete parking area. Old burnout marks and oil stains mar the cracked slab
where several junked fork-lifts sit. Several well-kept tool shelves sit up on
the docking area where old freighters would butt their trailers up to for
unloading. A set of crumbling stairs with a rusty handrail lead up to another
doorway that goes further into the structure.

left of the door; abandoned and covered in dust and old greasy hand prints.

   Beyond the entryway is a long corridor containing two metal staircases. One
leads upwards to a steel mezzanine that overlooks where the corridor continues
if you follow it. The corridor leads to another set of doors that has a
massive room beyond it stacked with huge dusty shipping containers. The other
staircase leads down into what looks like a sub-level.

Desc:$
   The bottom of the landing is dark, with only a flickering light bulb
suspended from the ceiling. In the room beyond, not much is visible. Overhead
piping and wires lead to some archaic looking boiler. A set of flickering
fluorescent bulbs set high into a far wall cut through the darkness to reveal
a door below them. The door looks to be made of thick metal and is set into a
concrete wall. The door has a slot at eye level thats currently closed.

Name:	A Basement Hideout
Desc:$
   Beyond the door is a dark room with cinder block walls situated somewhere
below the warehouse. A long wooden bar marred with gouges, yet still polished
to a sheen, sits off to your right. Plenty of bar stools sit before the bar
and a long brass footrest stretches the length of it. A barred street level
window filters in a meager amount of light from the sidewalk above. A card
table with old beer cans, poker chips and playing cards sits off in a dark
niche. Another steel door is set into a far wall.

   As you continue down the walkway you see another door set into the wall to
the north and another where the walkway ends to the east. The old railing is
the only thing that separates you from falling to your certain death into the
warehouse floor below. The handrail here looks old and wobbly and covered in
bird droppings. The sound of pigeons flapping echoes throughout the huge room
beyond guard rail as they are startled from their roost and alight on the
rafters.

all sorts of magic, philosophy, and religion, there are also a number of
fictional books. The only other decorations are a small painting of a
beautiful woman in a kimono and heavily silver inlaid wooden cross with a man
crucified on it.

Desc:$
   Upon entering this room, the first thing noticed is how well the layout of
everything is. A gun rack is in one corner with a foot locker set beside it,
both next to a bed with a pistol handle showing from under a pillow. A  little
refrigerator sets on the far wall and a little plug-in stove next to it. The
walls and floor are made of plywood. They look to be just thrown there to
cover up the mess that was there before. There is a square cut in the plywood
to give access to the window that was there before. All in all a pretty clean
room given the fact that it is located in not such a clean building.

from beyond an enormous wooden desk that dominates the center of the room. An
antique desk lamp with a green glass lamp-shade illuminates an ashtray full of
old cigarette butts and a disarrayed stack of ink stained ledgers. Small
particles of dust and smoke are illuminated as they drift through the fitful
light cast from a flickering street-lamp that lies beyond the half drawn
blinds of the office window taking up the entire wall behind the desk.

   A small corner of a warehouse that someone has cut out for themselves. It
appears that this room was probably an office at one time. Whatever it was
does not matter anymore as it now seems to be taken over by gypsies. There are
candles spaced randomly along the bare northen metal wall. The rest of the
walls are covered in ^Gt^Bi^Ye^Rd^Gy^Be ^Rt^Ma^Gp^Be^Gs^Yt^Mr^Ri^Be^Ms^n that have been  nailed in place. The
floor is covered in pillows of all shapes and sizes with a path to the bed at

off any other sents that may be present.

   This room looks like a large storage closet that was reclaimed and turned
into a small bedroom. The floor is covered by a plush rug. There's no bed, but
there's lots of pillows and blankets. The walls themselves are entirely
covered in a mural that wraps around across each of them. It begins with a
^yrustic cabin^n on a ^Ggreen hill^n. A young girl with ^Llong black hair^n wearing
^yprimitive leather clothes^n wanders down the hill towards a ^Br^Ci^Wv^Ce^Br, which runs
along the bottom of the entire mural, disappearing into a ^glush forest^n. Through
the ^gtrees^n dances a nude elven woman with beautiful ^Bb^Cl^Wu^Be hair^n. She cavorts
through the ^ggrowth^n, beautiful and unblemished, save for a ^rscar^n on her left
hand. A single ^Lblack bird^n flies through the sky overhead. The entire mural
pays great attention to detail in the ^Ggrass^n and ^gtrees^n, making the whole room
seem ^glush and verdant^n.
