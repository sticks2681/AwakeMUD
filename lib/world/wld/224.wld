Name:	Elemental Plane of Water
Desc:$
   Suspended between a pure, cloudless blue sky and a vast, but perfectly calm
ocean, you're surrounded by the phenomenal expanse of the elemental plane of
water, that extends almost as far as you can possibly see. From this high up,
you can see that the water is spread in a perfect, flat circle, and the
horizon is not a curvature of the land, but where the ocean fades into a black
void. You hear the faint sound of falling water coming from all around you as
the water disappears from the plane and into the darkness.

Name:	Elemental Plane of Wind
Desc:$
   Below a beautiful night sky, lit by thousands upon thousands of glimmering
stars, the plane of wind extends infinitely into the distance. You're hovering
in the midst of a few passing clouds, gazing down over a vast blackness. A
cool breeze constantly blows in your face, and a soft rumble fills the air.

Name:	Elemental Plane of Earth
Desc:$
   Standing in a clearing of dusty red soil, you are shadowed in the towering
expanse of a great canyon. Looking in both directions, it seems to go on
forever. The walls are rough and jagged, looking as though they've been
crumpled up from millions of years of seismic activity. They climb hundreds of
feet into the air on a slight incline, giving you the feeling that you're
under cover. At the ridge of the canyon an explosion of sunbeams from a
brilliant red sunset fills the roof with light.

Name:	Outside the SDA Plaza
Desc:$
   Standing here you see what was once the famed SDA plaza. The whole place
looks like a small chunk of Hiroshima just after the blast. Nothing but foot
high stumps of what was once walls, rubble, and charcoal is left, maybe you'd
better find somewhere else to be. Radiation isn't a nice thing.

Name:	Reception
Desc:$
   As you step into the air-conditioned comfort of the SDA reception area,
you're startled by the huge fountain in the center of the room.  It rises well
above the circular opening in the roof, and up into the first floor, and a few
holographic dolphins play around the base of it.  Around the outside of the
reception area are all sorts of help desks, tourist information centers and
souvenir shops, run by well-dressed, smiling human employees.  A few weary
looking shoppers pushing overflowing trolleys make their way out to the
parking area.  There's also an abundance of tropical plants, growing in well
kept planter boxes all around the edge of the room, that contrast nicely with
the soft, crimson carpet that covers the entire floor.

bones are flailed about, and spent shells, bloodied knives, and broken swords
and katanas are all over the place.  On the side of the ring is a cocky
looking human who looks at you and says, "Welcome to Fight Club."
    A sign is posted near the wall.

Desc:$
   Your footsteps don't echo as you walk across the wet concrete, covered in
soggy newspaper and rubbish.  Muffled music can be heard from the bar to the
southwest, through a rusty old steel door.  There are a few smears of blood on
the walls, and a couple of troll-sized teeth are scattered across the floor to
one side.  A half-opened dumpster overflows its filth onto the ground at the
far end, creating a pungent stench.  Rats scamper across the floor around it,
tinkling smashed bottles as they move, and a broken, flickering wall light
above the door illuminates this fetid alley.

   The bar is rectangular, with rounded edges, scattered with small puddles of
alcohol, and coasters advertising popular tourist spots in Seattle.  Behind
the counter are two kegs of beer, and a cheap looking dishwasher, while a
shelf with dozen or so bottles of spirits is mounted on the wall.  A couple of
beer advertisement posters are tacked up above it, along with a "Pook's Place"
logo.  To the northeast, a thick, steel door leads to an alley out back.

bar owners and friends, and scraps of paper advertising shadowrunners tacked
messily onto it.

   Three circular tables are arranged in an orderly fashion against the wall,
and a wall separates them from the bar.  A jukebox is set up in the corner,
playing almost anything you can think of, provided you've got the creds, at a
low volume.  On Sunday nights, this corner is cleared to make way for the
weekly darts contest, but right now, it looks like a good place to arrange
some business.

Name:	Pook's Place
Desc:$
   A favorite meeting place for shadowrunners in the Seattle area, Pook's
Place is a haven for street drek and derelicts of all shapes, sizes and
species. The floor is made of polished synthwood and a cloud of cigarette
smoke hangs hazily above the entire bar. The smell of alcohol and tobacco is
almost homey. As you glance around, you spot a few trolls laughing and
shooting some pool, and smile.
