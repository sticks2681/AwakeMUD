Name:	Hallway
Desc:$
   This hallway stinks of fresh paint while lights illuminate it.  The white
walls reflect the light with intensity, glinting off of door handles and
metallic objects carried.

Name:	Living Area
Desc:$
   The room is lit by a flickering overhead light that appears to be hanging
by one last screw in it's small rusty mounting. The air dense with smoke,
coursing about the room, blown about by the random draft. God awful lime green
shag carpet squishes and crunches about your feet as you enter various areas
of the estate. Bare, dull, and white sheetrock encloses all sides of this room
except to the east, where you find a doorway protruding.

Name:	Telemnar's Palace-o-Love'n
Desc:$
   The stench of week old rotton tuna aloft on particles of smoke manages to
drift into one of your nostrils, the smell reminds you slightly of the girls
who turn tricks down in Puyallup. This room is constructed as poorly as the
rest of the apartment, complete with sheetrock walls riddled with holes. The
most disturbing feature of the whole room is the fact the walls are lined with
pictures of female feet that have been haphazardly slicded and diced from
periodicals.
