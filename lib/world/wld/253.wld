Name:	Redmond Exit Ramp
Desc:$
   An exit sign along Route 520 details the merging lanes required to make it
to the ramp that leads into Redmond, and more specifically, Touristville.
Cement sound barriers are still present, but their construction isn't quite as
robust or as tall as on the main highway, allowing for somewhat of a view of
the township ahead.

Name:	Route 520 turn-off at Northeast 164th Avenue
Desc:$
   The township of Touristville comes into better view further down along the
ramp extending off of Route 520, the lack of sound barriers and other
obstructions aside from the buildings dotting the skyline offering a bit
better view of the lay of the land so to speak. It's almost hard to believe
that Redmond itself stands before you, since most of it is associated with the
Barrens, which consists of crumbling buildings and ruins. That isn't to say
that the area has been revitalized, it still has the atmosphere and appearance
for the most part, but it seems too... Alive? And not in a bad way.

Name:	Woodinville Road exit at 80th Street
Desc:$
   An exit ramp that branches off from 80th Street leads to the Woodinville
Road overpass, which leads traffic further up north towards Hollywood and
other areas adjacent of Touristville. The elevated roadway allows for a decent
view of the skyline of Touristville, which is a mix of abandoned buildings and
recently renovated ones all mixed together, giving it a hint of atmosphere one
would expect with Redmond, but with the life and vigor that simply can't be
found other places within it. The occasional flashing of red and blue lights
along with the wail of sirens can be heard, letting you know that just because
there's an actual Lone Star presence doesn't mean that crime committed by the
dregs of society still isn't an ongoing issue that has to be dealt with on a
daily basis.

Name:	Down Avondale Way
Desc:$
   Calling this a street is a bit of a stretch of the imagination, especially
since it's filled and lined on either end with dumpsters and garbage bins,
making it more akin to an alley or narrow side street that vehicles would have
quite a bit of trouble navigating. Fire escapes loom overhead, their rusted
silhouettes casting spindly shadows regardless of the time of day or night.
Several utility doors dot the sides of the buildings, but most of them are
blocked or boarded up, missing their hands or rusted shut, though one or two
of them might still be accessible.

Desc:$
   The transition and flow of vehicles at the corner of Redmond Way and
Northeast 168th Avenue is a little stiffled, mostly due to the adjoining
streets being in disrepair and being blocked off with construction. The
occasional worker can be seen attempting to wave traffic along and keep things
orderly, which is made all the more difficult due to the makeshift mall set up
on the corner, which dominates the area and adds quite a bit of congestion to
the mix.

place in attempt to breathe life into the area. A parking lot, most of which
consists of gravel and patches of pavement held together by weeds and a bit of
grass, opens up on the north side of the street, while another small road
splits off and heads down along its side, heading up further into the heart of
the town as it weaves its way through buildings.

Desc:$
   The main thoroughfare of Redmond Way continues to crawl along, a few old
buildings from decades past looming overhead that harken back to the days
before and after the crash that devastated the area. Some of them look a
little worse for wear than others, and some of the sport construction
coverings to indicate that they're being renovated, the attempts to breathe
life back into the area rather apparent. The economy may not come close to
some of the more developed areas outside the territory, but considering this
is Redmond, it's certainly better than anywhere else in the barrens.

Desc:$
   The amount of foot traffic, as well as vehicle traffic, picks up pace a bit
around this end of Redmond Way, one of the main reasons being the large
nightclub on the north side of the road. Better known as The Skeleton to
locals and tourists alike, it serves to draw in plenty of business despite the
fact that it's in Redmond. It certainly helps that the area has a Lone Star
presence, but that certainly doesn't disuade all of the less than polite
elements of society from poking their heads out of the shadows, after all,
tourists do make for good and often easy marks if they're not careful. A
spacious parking lot is set off to the side of the nightclub, its entrance and
exit signs posted accordingly to help keep vehicles moving smoothly so they
don't hold up traffic on the road.

   While not all of the buildings have been renovated or salvaged, it appears
they've done an admirable job of at least getting the main street of Redmond
Way cleaned up enough, all while still retaining that atmosphere of the
barrens that keeps the out of towners coming for more. It isn't uncommon to
find them around this area of Touristville, and the reason why can be seen
here, The Skeleton. You can easily tell that's what you're standing in front
of, as indicated by the large neon lit billboard that sports the upper body of
a ^rred skeleton^N against a black background, its tooth filled maw slightly open
as if beckoning travelers inside.

   This part of Touristville certainly seems more lively, as noted by the
increase of foot traffic as passerbys and bar hoppers that make their way from
nightclub to other watering holes that pepper the landscape. Another addition
towards that end is the increase in lights and the use of neon signs, which
are plastered across the sides of buildings for various establishments that
have been set up in an attempt to draw in patrons. In particular, one of the
larger signs is painted black with the lettering done in ^rred neon^N across it
features the words, "The Skeleton", along with a slowly blinking arrow that
points down the road east of here, giving anyone that isn't blind a good
indication as to where the place in question resides.

   Some lesser known corporations of the single and double A variety have
moved into the neighborhood, their presence best felt by their holdings, which
come in the form of steel reinforced concrete and large glimmering windows
that break up the skyline. Scrolling LED billboards and flashing
advertisements reflect and play across their surfaces in an almost hypnotic
dance of colour and light, which serves to distract passerbys that they are,
indeed, in Redmond. It tends to be a beneficial thing, after all, since that
in of itself is a bit depressing of a reality.

   This city has an odd atmosphere to it, to say the least. It's dreary and
depressing, but at the same time there's a vein of liveliness running through
it, cobbled together from blotches of light and sound and reinforced by the
fresh, new paint jobs of buildings looming overhead. It's the kind of scenery
that makes you want to drink away and drown your sorrows, but gives enough of
a grasp at the light at the end of the tunnel to convince you to get up
tomorrow to do it all over again. Optimistically suicidal, perhaps that's the
best way to put it into words? It could be worse, of course, the constant
reminder that the barrens aren't far away makes everything seem that much
better in comparison.

   Redmond Way serves as somewhat of a main street in these parts, helping to
bring the flow of traffic from outside the area and let it sweep easily
through some of the more revitalized scenery the place has to offer. The air
pollution is, oddly enough, not as bad as it is outside of Redmond, the main
reason being there are fewer vehicles and corporations operating out of the
area, though that isn't to say the air quality is going to receive high marks
any time soon. Redmond Way comes to an end a little west of here, where it
terminates and merges with an exit ramp leading to main highway system nearby,
while the road itself continues to stretch along and travel off further east
into the southern end of Touristville.

   Welcome to Touristville, which is technically part of Redmond, though it
may not be the barrens one most commonly associates it with. It still has a
bit of that barrens atmosphere and flair to it, but that's what makes it such
a great destination for out of towners who want to get a taste of the slums
without having to actually go into them. That isn't to say the area isn't
dangerous, the gangers are kept at a distance but that doesn't mean they don't
have any presence in the area. This remains the only area of Redmond to has
any actual Lone Star patrols, which helps keep some of the less than desirable
elements of society from getting too out of hand. That being said, it's best
you venture into this place with a bodyguard or a sidearm if you know what's
good for you.

   While it was at one point a proper road, recent renovations have left it a

fire escapes looming overhead and offering a glimpse of what the place used to
look like, since it appears they haven't gotten around to replacing or
scrubbing all of the rust off of them yet.

   Upon entering Touristville, there seems to be a rather blatant dichotomy at
play here, which takes the form of old vs. new. The buildings themselves are
probably the best indicator of such a battle taking place, as various
companies and corporations are attempting to elbow their way back into
Redmond, which they hastily abandoned and fled from decades ago. Some of the
old ghosts are still hanging around in the form of ruined buildings, which
stand side by side by their newer, renovated counterparts that bring a bit of
life back into the area.

   A thin haze of smog and pollution hangs over the area, which is, oddly
enough, not quite as imposing as it is in other more developed areas such as
Downtown Seattle or the outlying cities and territories. Flashes of neon
lights flicker and light up the skyline as they're emitted from the collection
of billboards and other advertisements plastered across any building still
capable of holding up their weight, though some of them are having enough
trouble dealing with their own to be troubled by these parasitic glimmers of
modern landscaping. Northeast 164th Avenue continues its journey off to the
north and south, while a set of traffic lights dictates passage onto 79th
Street as it heads off to the east.

   An attempt to put some colour back into the city that doesn't consist of
drab shades of grey and brown can be seen lining this section of road, upon
each side of which are small native trees that have been planted to bring a
bit of life back into the city. Granted, there's plenty of life already, but
most of it consists of street urchins, devil rats and other less than pleasant
natives that haven't been driven out of the area yet. Old graffiti has been
painted over on most of the surfaces here, though some of the thinner sections
still let it their designs and colours show through despite the attempts to
cover them up.

Desc:$
   The corners of Northeast 164th Avenue and 80th Street meet up here, and
while they used to stretch further out along the north and west, one of the
older buildings that couldn't be saved has crumbled. The debris is strewn
across the road in huge chunks, and while efforts have been made to clean them
up, they've managed to ruin most of the pavement and cement beneath, making
for unstead ground for both vehicle and foot traffic. A few traffic cones and
barriers are set up to keep anyone from attempting to drive down them, and
while there's an occasional construction vehicle or two to be found nearby, it
doesn't appear as if there's any ongoing attempts to quicken the job along.

   Most of the buildings along this stretch of road are in working order, and
while they may not be in the best of shape, a new paint job and electricty
goes a long way to upgrading their appearances. A few shops and the occasional
bar line the road, since with most places, booze always sells the best when
the atmosphere isn't up to par. It's one of the reasons that makes this place
popular with out of towners, it also serves to keep the economy growing since
an increase in revenue is always a good thing regardless of an areas
development. A bar on the side of the road here is indicated by a small,
simple sign that reads, "The Downfall".

   This intersection stands out from the landscape for a few reasons, one of
which is likely due to the fact that some of the nearby properties are
actually in fairly good condition. Another reason is likely due to the
crosswalks and sidewalks having been ripped up and torn out, only to be
replaced by fitted brick pavers in an attempt to give this strip of road a bit
of character. It already had character previously, but it definitely wasn't
the good kind, so this is a good change of pace for a city that's attempting
to drag itself out of the frag cluster that Redmond used to be. It seems
they're doing a pretty good job at it to boot.

   Flashes of multi-coloured light and the sound of sirens in the distance are
pretty common place here it seems, and even the occasional gun shot ringing
out nearby isn't exactly a rare occurrence. There's plenty of shadows and
cracks around these parts for the dregs of society to slip through unnoticed
and unaccounted for, which always makes for both a depressing atmosphere, as
well as a chance to earn some cred if one knows where to look.

   While most of the buildings are in rough shape, at least a few are getting
a bit of life breathed back into them by the attempts of revitalization that
is sweeping through Touristville these days. One of them in particular appears
to be brand new, so much so that it remains unfinished on the last few stories
near the top, a few steel beams poking up into the skyline to make themselves
known. 80th Street continues its journey from west to east through here,
winding its way between buildings that differ quite a bit from one another as
far as disrepair and reconstruction are concerned.

   Just a small distance away from what could be considered normal downtown
scenery are the vestiges of the areas rather grim past, which come in the form
of the occasional abandoned and vacant building that has been long since
condemned and boarded up, their surfaces plastered with graffiti from local
gangers and their ilk. Just a little further up and down the road things seem
to be in much better shape, while the occasional alley way, like the one on
the east side of the street, are still places you're likely to get stabbed or
mugged for amusement or necessity. This is Redmond, chummer, don't you forget
it.

Desc:$
   This intersection is dominated by the towering office buildings that have
gone up in the last year or two, most of which are already seeing business
from both local and natives alike. The former are attempting to cash in on the
new markets, or simply looking for cheap rent and building costs in a newly
developed area, while the latter are a bit more interested in attempting to
make the local economy more robust to help get it back on its feet. Most most
of the buildings have been snatched up by lower end corporations and
businesses, one might be surprised to see that some of the bigger mover and
shakers are slowly letting their tendrils creep into the area in hopes of
taking advantage of the situation.

   An attempt at renovating some of the older buildings that have fallen into
disrepair over the last few decades is underway, though it hasn't been
entirely successful if the old skeletons of buildings and the low end
skyscraper still littering the drab skyline are of any indication. Some
offices, most of which are currently vacant, are under construction, which
share the block with a few shops and commercial level warehouses used mostly
for storage, their security doors locked up tightly and their windows barred
to keep some of the less than polite elements of society from hassling them.
An alley way with old chainlink fence edging heads off towards the east
through the base of a few of the larger buildings, while the street itself
continues along at a steady pace to the north and south.

   There isn't much to take in as far as scenery goes, not unless you enjoy a
looming low level skyscraper, which is a bit of a misnomer since they don't
really protrude that far up. Some of them are in better shape than others, but
that tends to be what happens when an area is allowed to fall into ruin for
decades on end. It's surprising how quickly and easily they degrade, and in
fact, it would be just as easy to assume that a natural disaster had hit the
area rather than being a man made issue. A smaller street branches off south
from this road, cutting its way inbetween two of the taller buildings dotting
the skyline.

Name:	Avondale Way, near the mall
Desc:$
   Avondale Way slinks its way along at a relatively slow pace, the reason why
likely being that it's quite a bit more narrow than most of the streets around
here, and in fact, probably used to be nothing more than an alley way that had
been cleared out of dumpsters and other old garbage, some of which still
remains. The double doors of an entrance way filter foot traffic as it mills
in and out of the makeshift mall on the eastern side of the road.

Name:	Intersection of 79th Street and Avondale Way
Desc:$
   The wider main road of 79th Street cuts clear through this section of
buildings, while off on each side of it are two smaller side streets. The
branch that leads off south seems relatively spacious enough to accomodate
most vehicles, while the northwestern pathway is blocked by the remains of an
old chainlink fence that hasn't been completely removed, not to mention the
dumpsters and other garbage that seek to block foot traffic.

Name:	Heading down Avondale Way
Desc:$
   Despite it being listed as a street, it doesn't appear there is much room
to navigate any kind of vehicle down this alley way of a side road with
anything larger than a bike. Rusted grates are set into the pavement, which is
set at a slight angle to allow rain water and gutter run off to collect and
flow into the sewers below. Several metal doors lead off from the alley into
the buildings on either side, though most are locked and barred up to keep
anyone from tresspassing. The occasional flickering of a dull neon sign helps
to light up a small portion of the side street, which apparently belongs to,
if one is to trust it, "Dr. Bob's Quickstitch Clinic". A medical clinic in the
back of a seedy alley? What's not to trust?

Name:	Along Northeast 168th Avenue
Desc:$
   The pavement along this stretch of Northeast 168th Avenue is in some of the
best condition seen so far, which is impressive since it's been quite a number
of decades since it's been put down. A length of chainlink fencing spans the
western block just beyond the wide sidewalk, encompassing the entirety of the
large parking lot of the nearby mall. A few openings are designated for the
entrance and exits, which feature rolling gates so they can be closed up and
locked down during night time hours if necessary. While it might not keep all
of the street urchins at bay, it does an adequate job of keeping a good deal
of the squatters from setting up camp and needing to be chased out in the
mornings.

Name:	79th Street and Northeast 168th Avenue
Desc:$
   This three way intersection of streets is adorned with an occasional old,
abandoned office building in the middle of renovation, though considering the
electricity running to some of them, it's safe to assume they've been
reclaimed and are in the process of being put back to good use. Either that or
squatters with a little technical know how have set up stakes, it's a little
hard to tell. The native population is still around, despite attempts to chase
them off and keep them from getting too comfortable during their stay, there's
still plenty of room (and buildings) for them to slip through the cracks, some
more literal than figurative.

   A fenced in parking lot takes up most of this stretch of roadway, beyond
which is a spacious parking lot with a small sea of vehicles in various stages
of repair or disarray. A few of the buildings are under construction nearby,
but for the most part it seems like a bit of a ghost town towards this edge of
Touristville, the flow of foot traffic and locals alike giving way to a more
gritty population of urchins and street vendors trying to peddle their less
than high quality wares.

   An overpass system for a nearby highway can be seen further off east, while
80th Street itself stretches off into the distance back to the west from here.
Several recently repainted road signs dot the landscape, along with some
buildings of the same nature to match. It would probably be easy to overlook
the fact that you're in Redmond, it definitely doesn't look this nice no
matter where you are, even if you are a squatter or street urchin with low
standards.

Desc:$
   The traffic is a bit stymied at the corner of these two roads, with 80th
Street stretching off to the west and NE 168th Avenue heading off to the
south. The reason probably has to do with the Woodinville exit ramp that
spills traffic out onto the two, that and apparently nobody really pays
attention when they're driving, which hasn't changed since the invention of
the automobile. Fortunately, which a functioning gridguide network, things
aren't as terrible as they could be, so there's at least a bit of silver
lining to that dark cloud.

Several 'coming soon' signs can be found in their windows, while others are

a comfortable place to stroll. A small side street dips through a pair of the
taller buildings here off to the north, which makes the main road here look
massive in comparison.

Desc:$
   One of the newest additions to the area can be found here in the form of a
new office buildings that still haven't found any businesses to occupy them.
The reason why is fairly clear, especially since they stand out in stark
difference to the old ruins nearby, though with any luck in another year or
two those will be torn down and replaced with similarly constructed offices.
This section of town has a long way to go still, but it's good to see that the
locals are attempting to bring businesses, and the jobs that accompany them,
back to the area.

a common sight around these parts, and this just so happens to be one of the
downsides to it. It interupts the normal flow of life, as well as traffic,
both of the foot and vehicle variety. The buildings on either side of the
street are in somewhat the same shape, either in the process of being built
back up or torn down for a new lease on life.

Name:	In front of Crusher 495 on 79th Street
Desc:$
   Traffic picks up a little down this stretch of road, the reason why should
be rather evident since there are a number of bars and other establishments
catering to the elements of society that enjoy those types of things. One
building in particular, Crusher 495, can be found here. It has found itself
quite popular not only with the local metahuman scene, but with Humanis as
well, the latter of which isn't necessarily the good kind of interest. While
the occasional attack isn't unheard of, it actually does little to disuade the
community, and if anything it only earns those groups a worse name while
strengthening the resolve of those who find themselves under assault. The
street continues its way along from west to east.

Name:	Along 80th Street
Desc:$
   Some of the buildings are in pretty rough shape, their long since ruined
facades peeled and cracked and threatening to crumble the more time passes by.
It's plain to see that none of them are currently in use, aside from perhaps
as a brief stop for squatters, though they're often routed out and chased off
by the locals attempting to get the city back on its feet. At least one of the
buildings has been completely torn down, or rather, is in the final stages of
deconstruction, with little more than an old rusted skeleton of steel with a
few blocks of crumbling concrete clinging to dear life to it.

Desc:$
   An assortment of buildings in various stages of renovation dot each end of
this section of road, some of which are in much better shape than others. A
gap in the buildings on the northern side of the road opens up and leads into
a spacious lot, which at first glance looks to be empty until one takes notice
of the large vinyl signs posted here and there. It seems a restaurant or some
sort of eatery has been opened up there, or at least that's the indication
given.

Name:	Heading along 80th Street
Desc:$
   A few rough patches in the road way make for a jittery ride both on foot
and in a vehicle, and the large crack in the pavement that stretches from one
side of the road to the other, then clear across the sidewalks, and then up a
story or two one of the buildings nearby doesn't exactly put any passerbys at
ease when traveling past them. Fortunately, most of the other buildings are in
better shape, and the ones that aren't are smaller, so there shouldn't be much
risk of them causing too much damage if they took a dive, as unlikely as that
is.

Name:	In front of an old bar on 80th Street
Desc:$
   Quite a number of buildings have been reclaimed from abandonment along this
stretch of 80th Street, most of which have been converted into liqour stores,
gun shops and bars, which tend to be the most useful things to the general
population in high crime areas. Go figure. One old bar in particular, "The
Banshee", as the sign out front insists, seems to be one of the more laid back
joints around, especially since most of them seem to be nightclubs and scenes
for the younger and rougher crowds. That isn't to say you won't find plenty of
gruff visitors to these places either, there's plenty of those to go around no
matter where you are.

Name:	At 80th Street and Northeast 167th Street
Desc:$
   Along the northern end of Touristville, 80th Street continues to wind its
way along in a fairly straight forward process, even if the pavement is a
little uneven. It was originally straight as an arrow, but now a days the road
has a bit of a bend to it. It's slated to be fixed somewhere in the next few
years, but they've yet to make any real progress along this stretch of road by
the looks of things. The gutters and sewer grates don't seem to be affected by
the slant, so it isn't causing too much trouble. A smaller side street opens
up to the south as it dips between a line of rugged buildings that have been
recently repainted and renovated.

Desc:$
   The fire escapes are clearly quite old and haven't seen a good cleaning,
let alone a fresh coat of paint in decades. Understandably, this has left them
in poor shape as they attempt to stand up to the elements, leaving large
portions of their steel construction rusted and weakened, with some of the
steps and ladders threatening to give way and fall onto the streets below.

   There's little in choices in the matter, it's either up or down at this
point. The windows of the building the fire escape is attached to have been
boarded up with thick planks of wooden and nailed fifty different ways. Some
of the windows appear to have debris pressed up against them from inside,
perhaps from a partial collapse of the interior, making it impossible to climb
inside from this end.

   The top of the fire escape leads onto the rooftop of the building it is
attached to, though that isn't to say it'll be a safe trip by any means due to
the poor shape the structure is in. The steps and ladders of the fire escape
are a little loose and most of it sways under the movement of those attempting
to climb up or down it. The street below is a good ways down, so it'd probably
be best to take your time and be careful should you decide to use it.
