Name:	A serene place for Rifkin to hide at because people are mean.
Desc:$
   It is a room. Not a good room nor a bad room, just a room. 6 sides, all
colorless... yet full of the rainbow, creating peace for Rifkin, in his putrid
life of turmoil.

Name:	The Jail
Desc:$
   A cement floor, ceiling and three walls, this place is the poster-child of
dreary.  There are two windows on the southern room, barred to the max. To the
north lies a large wrought iron door on a slide track.  It is through here
that everything comes in. On the western corner is a set of bunkbed style cots
with no blankets, for this room is a warm temperature. 
   Gouges in the floor and walls, alongside of large chunks broken out,
suggests that fights have occured in here.

   This is a very business like room that has few people in it, yet a
disturbing presence hangs over it.  To the east is a door to the jail cells.

to the south is the exit out of here.

Desc:$
   Between the armory and the bunks, this is just a beaten down path.  Some
men walk up and down this, entering the armory to get ammo, armor, or maybe
even a rifle.  The trail beneath the feel is smoothened, narrow, and lined by
the grass from the field.
