Heya, chumma, ya lookin fer somethin' to take up ya time? Somethin' profitable perhaps?~
Well, guess ya ain't got the sack for it...anotha time then.~
Fraggin slitch...get outta my sight and be glad I dont have ya killed for wastin my time.~
Well done.~
I got somethin for ya, chummer. As you probably know me and my...shall we say
family, have been runnin the BTL business for quite a long time here in da
sprawl. Now word comes to me that the Yaks have been gettin a little too
involved in our biz. I've got some info says there are a couple of deals goin
down today, one at the famed Dante's Inferno, and another at a little place
down in Chiba called the Cherry Blossom Inn, probably in one of the meeting
rooms... I'm sure you can guess what we want you to do to the people involved
in those meetings eeh? Also, that package there, when you've toasted the Yaks
and whoever they're dealing with, I want that package delivered to my boss Don
Bonanno, you'll probably find him havin' a drink at the Company of Thieves Club
out in Tacoma at the monorail station. When all this is done, come back here
and I'm sure I can pay ya quite a bit for your time and effort.
