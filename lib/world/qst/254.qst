I've got some wetwork on tap. You interested?~
Shame, chummer.~
Null persp, I'll find someone more suited to the task.~
Good job, the world now has one less hate monger.~
I'll keep it short and simple, chummer. The "Righteous" Reverend Clayton
Mackelman has been a thorn in the side of all metahumans for far too long,
spewing his hate speech and riling up the believers into committing violence
against metas that have done nothing wrong aside from being born. He needs to
be "silenced", once and for all. You'll likely find him preaching over at The
First Church of the Lord in Redmond Barrens. Come back when the task is done
and I'll see to it you're compensated.

Null perps. I'll find someone with talent to handle it.~
Good work, chummer.~
It has recently come to my attention that a particular Humanis group has been
putting together an agenda. It's obvious what their end game is, clearly, but
the details of the new project they have in the works eludes my associates. A
business in Southwest Seattle known as Erehwon Graphic Design appears to have
a few ties to the group in question, so here's where you come in. I want you
to infiltrate their host and find any project datafile that seems connected to
them, which will likely be named some less than pleasant euphemism for their
racist agenda. Return it to me and the creds are all yours.

Nicely done, one less racist fragger in the world.~
Here's the skinny. Out in Western Puyallup you'll find a policlub operated by
the Hand of Five, a group of hate mongers who want nothing more than the
extermination of metahumanity as whole. Your job is to wring the neck of that
fragger Carlton Clemente, one of their lieutenants. He should have a manifesto
of the policlub activities at hand, when you're finished dealing with him take
the manifesto and drop it off in the Cathedral Manor down in the Ork
Underground. Just drop it off, leave it on the ground, my associates will take
care of the pickup themselves.

Well done.~
It has come to the attention of my associates that an act of terrorism is
being put into motion by the Hand of Five policlub faction. It appears they're
already in the late stages of their plans and are likely in the process of
carrying out this attack as we speak, our intention is for you to put a stop
to it. The target in question is the Night of Rage memorial in Western Tacoma,
and word coming down the pipeline is that their operatives will attempt to
blend into the crowd to make spotting them troublesome. Go and take care of
these racist bastards, every last one of them, but be sure not to bring any
harm to the innocent tourist, civilians and guards that are likely to be mixed
in as well. Pick your targets carefully, chummer.

Shame.. I'll find a real shadowrunner instead.~
Impressive, you have my respect.~
I'll give it to your straight, chummer, this is a risky operation. One of the
policlub big wigs is in town holding a liturgy, and it's the best chance we
have to strike a telling blow against their organization. Your target is Grand
Wizard Shankmire, as the name suggests, he's a powerful magic wielder and a
dangerous zealot, using religion and fear to preach his hate speech. Word is
he's set up services down in Auburn in one of the abandoned buildings, but we
haven't narrowed down which. Get yourself down there and silence this voice of
intolerance once and for all. Be careful, he'll have highly trained bodyguards
accompanying him, so make sure you deal with them as well before hightailing
it out of there.

Good work, chum.~
I hope you're of the athletic variety, chummer, because you're going to be
doing some climbing on this job. There's an old defunct turnstile antenna
rusting away on top of one of the buildings in Touristville, over near the
block of Northeast 167th Street. I'll leave it up to you as far as figuring
out how to get on top of it and locating the antenna in question. Once you
find it, you'll need to scale it all the way to the very top, which is where
you'll place this device. Assuming you survive the climb back down, come back
to me for your payment.

The son of one of my associates was out for a night on the town, slumming it
in the Touristville club scene a few nights back. The problem is, he never
came back home after that. *Shows you a holo-pic of young human male with
freckled brown skin and wild multi-coloured hair wearing a stylish leather
jacket* His father is at his wits end, wondering if he ran off with some
gutter skank, or got himself into some kind of trouble. The last time anyone
saw him was down at The Skeleton in Touristville. I want you to go there and
poke around, see if you can find any leads. If you find any come back here and
share them with me and I'll compensate you for your troubles.

Null persp. I'll find someone capable.~
Best news I've gotten all day.~
I have been busy gathering information on two individuals who were last seen
with the son of one of my associates who went missing. It has come to my
attention that these two belong to the notorious Halloweener gang based out of
Redmond. Word on the street is that they have been bragging over having
murdered and robbed the missing man, so it's time to stop searching for clues
and dishing out some justice. The two gangers in question are known as Mad
Bull Watts, and an ork by the name of Chiggers, who are known to hang out in
an old wrecked house near the abandoned Lone Star precinct near Moonlight
Mall. Kill them both, along with any other gangers they happen to be with. Be
sure to bring back some proof and give it to me so the work can be guaranteed.

A client is in a bit of a pickle, and time is of the essence. I need you to

The client this time around is Aurelia Gaines, an elven dame from Portland who
needs to make a timely escape for reasons I won't get into. She'll be waiting
for you down there at Surehand Square Public Amphitheatre. Since she's flying
under the radar you'll need to head back via the Hellhound Bus, though her
pursuers likely know this as well. Keep an eye peeled out for anyone that
tries to do her harm, and pay them back ten fold. The job will be finished

That's a shame. Another time, perhaps.~
I see.. Such a shame.~
I'm very pleased with your work.~
We require assistance from a hunter that isn't afraid of getting their hands
dirty, which is where you come in. The target in question is a martichoras, an
aggressive, carnivorous beast the size of a large lion, which also has a
similar appearance to one, with some slight differences. It was last spotted
prowling around the fields of a Sinsearach settlement down off of Highway 229,
so getting there to begin with may be a bit troublesome. Careful, this beast
has already killed several people. Slay it and return to me for your payment.

Up for a critter hunt, chummer?~
That's just too bad.~
I see. Too bad, chum.~
Nice hunting.~
It has come to our attention that a certain critter is prowling around the Ork
Underground tunnels on the south end of the settlement. The creature in
question is known as the Buwaya, which is native to the Philipines. We're not
certain how it got here, but chances are it's either an escapee from a zoo in
the city or it was someones pet. Either way, it needs to be taken care of.
You'll recognize it easily, since it'll be the smallest, fattest crocodile
you've ever laid eyes on. Don't be fooled by its appearance, it's a fearsome
predator in its own right, so take caution when dealing with it. Destroy it
and return to me for your payment.

Good job with the hunt.~
Your target this time around is a Dzoo-Noo-Qua, which is a troll that was
infected with HMHVV. The virus has reduced its intelligence to the level of an
animal, so don't worry about the fact that it used to be a metahuman, you'll
be doing it a favour by putting it out of its misery. It was last spotted
around the ruins of the old Mowich Bridge out past the Coal Plains of
Puyallup, so it's more than likely it's camping out in the structure. Find it,
kill it, and return to me for your payment.

Fine hunting, chummer.~
This hunt may involve a bit of exploration and tracking to finish, not to
mention the critter in question isn't a pushover, you'd best be careful. The
target is known a Wild Minotaur, and while it does appear similar to the
metahuman of the same namesake, it is little more than an animal, granted, a
very large animal. This nocturnal hunter has been prowling around the old
mining tunnels out towards the western edge of Puyallup, so you'll first have
to find a way down there. Track it down to its lair once you have, exterminate
it, and return to me for your payment as usual.

This hunt is going to require you to fly down to the Caribbean League, Grenada
in particular, so I hope your paperwork is in order. We've received reports
that a sea leech has been lurking around Crayfish Bay, which is just a short
distance north off the coast of the city of Victoria. This particular sea
leech has proven troublesome to deal with, and it has been ruining nets and
small fishing boats on a regular basis, which is why we've been contracted to
send a hunter with a particular skill set down to deal with. I hope you don't
mind getting a little wet, chummer. Exterminate this creature and return here

I hope you're not afraid of cemeteries, chummer. A small band of goblins,
which are HMHVV infected dwarves for reference, have taken up residence in the
old Redmond Cemetary. We don't expect you to exterminate all of them, so we'll
settle on going for the throat. Most goblins are little more than animals that
crave flesh, but a particular goblin by the name of Bittermaw, whose a bit
more intelligent than his kin, has set himself up as the leader of this little
coven. We want you to track him down and take him out along with any
underlings he has with him. Return to me when you've finished the deed.

While we normally wouldn't condone hunting anything that is sentient and
intelligent, we're making an exception this time around. A trio of nagas,
dangerous mystical serpents, have been causing quite a bit of trouble. They're
working under The Joker, a crafty and deadly spirit who has set up a base of
operations on an abandoned ship known as the Bradenton. You can catch a ride
to it on the West Tacoma ferry. The trio of nagas go by the names of Primrose,
Lily and Lantana. We need you to exterminate all three of them in one fell
swoop, and of course, you'll be compensated nicely for your services when you
return from the task.

Our friends over at Bicson Biomedical are at the cutting edge of medical
technologies... Which is a benefit to us, because that's who you'll be
stealing from. They've recently produced some high quality synthesized
beta-endorphins that have applications for cyberware and bioware surgery
recovery purposes, but they're not the kind of people who enjoy sharing their
stocks. This is where you come in. I need you to break into the Bicson
Biomedical compound up in Everett, they should have cold storage rooms in
their basements, so assuming you survive the trip and make it down there,
snatch up a container of these synthesized beta-endorphins and bring it back
to me and we'll handle your payment.

A local patient at the Bryserson Medical Clinic just north of Chinatown
recently expired, nobody special mind you. What is special, however, is that
they are a perfect match for one of my associates daughter who is in dire need
of a transplant. What with all the red tape that goes along with it, she'll
likely die before ever getting to the top of the list, while some rich fat
cats pay their way to the top in her place. We've gotten word that they've
already performed the extraction of the organs and they're currently being
stored in one of their supply rooms until they can be transported to a larger
hospital. We need you to sneak in and steal them, and bring the container and
its contents back to me. There's no need for violence, since their security is
so lax, so don't go starting trouble if you don't have to.

I've got a bit of wetwork on tap.~
That's a shame, chum.~
Null persp, I'll find someone else to do it.~
Very nice, chummer.~
I hope you're not squeamish, chummer, so I'll give it to you straight, this is
wetwork with a bit of a catch. The target in question is one Mr. Cleveland
Deleon, a corporate executive from a AA corp that isn't of any consequence.
Mr. Deleon should be relaxing in the Lysleul Plaza baths they have on the
upper floors there. We want you to go over there and end his life, plain and
simple, and afterwards we want you to cut out one of his kidneys and bring it
back to me. Don't feel too bad, chummer, this guy is in with the Tamanous,
notorious organ leggers who cut up homeless people and street urchins for a
profit. The plan is to make it seem like they've had a falling out and
unsettle his corporate backers in hopes that they cut ties with the
organization. He'll likely have a pair of bodyguards with him, so be sure to
silence them as well before returning with the goods.

Matrix infiltration, up for some?~
I see, can't cut it in the trix eh?~
The trix is too much for ya, huh?~
Good job, chummer.~
Seeing as how we can't afford to run any quality research projects here, we
prefer to let those that are much better equipped to carry them out, and then
sneak in and swipe the results afterwards. That's where you come into play,
chummer. Johnson Newbody Labs up in East Tacoma has been running some
experimental studies that we're interested in, but they have no outside lines
to tap into. You'll need to physically infiltrate their compound, make your
way to the servers in the basement, and then run a search for experimental
trials. Once you've got the data in hand, drop it off with me and we'll get
your payment in order. Sound good?

Pretty cut and dry matrix run this time around, chummer. I need you to find

Afraid to take the risk, huh? No worries.~
Good job with that risky business, chummer.~
While the concept of a smash and grab is simple, it may be easier said than
done. It seems Novatech has been busy working on a new prototype cyberarm for
use in shipping and construction yards that's geared towards high energy
output and designed for labour intensive tasks. We've gotten word that they
plan on shipping out a unit for field testing, so we need you to slip into
Novatech and find your way to their storage areas and shipping areas, which
should be on the sixth floor. Take care of any security that gives you trouble
and secure the unit, afterwards return here with it and hand it over, we'll
deal with your payment afterwards.

The Yellow Lotus needs some pruning.~
No? Get lost then.~
You serious? Never trust a waegukin to get a job done..~
Goob job, waegukin.~
A few days back one of our boys ran afoul of the Yellow Lotus, one of the
Triad syndicates that operates out of the Seattle area. They left him alive,
but he would have been better off dead, if you catch my drift. Unfortunately,
we can't respond without provoking retribution, or even worse, all out war, so
we've decided to outsource this task to a third party. Down in Chinatown there
is an establishment known as Yun's bar where some of the Yellow Lotus are
known to frequent. The three in particular we want taken care of are known as
Shen Dahzong, Fang Hua and Jing Lao. They're really dangerous fraggers, so
don't half-ass this chummer. Once you've taken care of them we'll talk about
your pay.

The Yellow Lotus Triad and the Yakuza have been getting along a little too
well for our liking recently, so we plan on throwing a wrench in those gears.
That's where you come in, waegukin. Take this emei dagger, the Yellow Lotus
are known for using them in fights. We want you to hitch a ride up to the
Rubber Suit, a yak run establishment out in Everett. The target in question is
Hibiki Kaimu, one of their soldiers who hangs out and drinks there. Kill him
nice and good, then leave this emei dagger behind on the floor near the body
to make it seem like a Triad hit. Head back after you're finished those tasks
and I'll get you your nuyen.

We want you to stroll on down to Chinatown and see if you can find one of

Very well, another time perhaps.~
It's a big pond, I'll find another fish.~
Seems things went smoothly.~
Word around the net is that a certain establishment in Downtown Seattle has
been playing it a bit loose with the law. It seems they've been operating a
data mining scheme that's going a few steps too far, which I doubt they'll be
all too fond of having light shed upon to the public. I need you to infiltrate
the Espanoza Way Complex host, better known as the ECW Complex, and search
through their accounting node for any logs of these data mining activities.
Once you've secured them, slip over to the Seattle Voice host and upload your
findings to their forums for public consumption.

I hope you know the ropes when it comes to the matrix, otherwise you might

just a well mannered small business owner, but behind the scenes he's one of
the go to guys when it comes to getting information, mostly of the less than
legal kind. The establishment in question is known as The Cave, and within its
public host is a hidden datastore, I want you to take this surveillance
software and upload it into the node. We'll settle your payment upon your
return, assuming all went well that is.

Very well, another time, another contract.~
Very professional, chummer.~
Impressive, chummer.~
One of my benefactors is interested in a two pronged assault upon
Aztechnology's holdings in Seattle, which is where you come into the picture.
The first part of the job consists of an assassination, or rather, two of
them. Maria Cruzan, the Executive Officer of Aztechnology Public Relations has
been a bit careless with her words directed at certain parties, so the best
solution is to silence her, permanently, before she does so again. The other
target is Emilio Pascua, a dangerous man in his own right, even without the
backup he'll likely have handy. These two will likely be accompanied by
various security personnel, so you better be good, or have get the job done
quietly. The last bit of business is to snag a utility projects data disk from
the board room upstairs, so complete the other objectives, secure the data
disk and bring it back to me and you'll get paid.

It seems one of our mutual friends over at the Seattle Voice has gotten
himself in a bit too deep, and apparently ticked off the kind of people who
would prefer he end up dead in a ditch somewhere. The journalist in question
is currently hunkered down and hiding in an old, torched out and rebuilt auto
shop along Burton Street in the Redmond Barrens. It seems that some of these
violent individuals are closing in on his location, fast, so I need you to
hurry over there as fast as you can and secure his safety. Take care of anyone

No shame in admitting you're not good enough, chum.~
I see.. Why did you accept the terms to begin with?~
Very well done. A real pro.~
Let me make this as clear as possible, this job is dangerous, very dangerous.
One of my benefactors is interested in a certain Novatech executive, or to be
more precise, he's interested in what this executive has come into possession
of. Our intel tells us that this executive is about to leave town on business,
and is bringing the item in question with him, so we only have one shot of
snagging it before it'll be beyond our reach. On the top floor of the Novatech
headquarters in Seattle there is a helipad, which is where our friend is
getting picked up. If and when you manage to make it there, be extremely
careful, he'll likely have elite bodyguards protecting him, and those fraggers
aren't pushovers. Underestimate them at your own peril. Eliminate the
bodyguards, the executive, and once you've secured the briefcase he'll have
with him hightail it out of there and return it to me. We'll settle your
payment afterwards.

It seems Karen King over at the Knight Center has managed to ruffle a few
feathers too many. The job is straight forward, eliminate her. She also has a
set of blueprints in her possession, and our intel suggests it'll probably be
stored in some kind of concealed back room in her office, so you'll need to
search the place to get ahold of them. Her office is up on the 14th floor of
the Knight Center, and while most of the time there isn't much in the way of
personnel working there that doesn't mean security won't be doing their job
regardless. Secure the blueprints and return them to me after taking care of
the target.
