I've got a small job for you.~
That's too bad... Later, chummer.~
Awww, well I suppose someone else could fulfill the task.~
Great job. I'll put out a good word for you.~
Not too long ago, a team of shadowrunners from the Halloweeners gang had
stolen a valuable prototype from my corporation. Rumor says they are planning
on selling the prototype to Ares. My sponsors wouldn't be pleased. Somewhere
in the Halloweeners headquarters is a stealth microwave laser weapon
prototype, which my sponsoring corporation had developed. Retrieve it and we'll
pay you well.

This job is a simple courier gig. What makes it rough is that its a courier
gig to Portland. Take this datachip, don't try to decrypt what's on it; ya
won't be able to, and give it to Robert James Hark the Third in Portland. He
will meet ya at the Satyricon.

Great work, chummer.~
A while back, my sponsors were involved in an archaeological dig in South
America, exploring a newly discovered temple ruins, created by a civilization
thought to be older than the Incas. At one point, they discovered a tome, a
lost tome of magick which had a strange radiation on the astral plane. Word
got out about this to a competitor, Aztechnology, and they geeked our
archaeological team and stole the tome. I believe they are using this tome...or
are trying to. Our experts sense that if the secret is unlocked of this tome,
the tome of Arcazon, it could spell disaster, if the powers are used
improperly. One more detail. A page had been torn from the book and may be
separated from the rest of the Tome. We need you to find the tome and the
page that was removed. We will pay you VERY well to complete this task.

Ok, here's the deal, a plain parcel with a label on it reading "ERRONEOUS" has
been removed from the Saeder-Krupp lab from Doctor Lords. He can only travel
so far beyond the gates of Saeder Krupp Tarislar Research Center, so he had to
place it in a abandoned police station across the street, rather than come
deliver it to me himself. Go to Tarislar and retrieve the parcel, bring
it back to me, and you will get paid well.

I have been stolen from, and my superiors are holding me responsible for it.
The plans for the DEF-550 residential defense system have been stolen, and
retrieval of it is beyond my power. This is where you come in. Being a
reputable shadowrunner, I imagine Mitsuhama's dark core is within your reach.
Executive Toho's shadowrunners have given him my plans, with Yukiya Dahayoto
as his go-between. I need you to retrieve the plans; a datachip and the
blueprints, that he is probably gloating over this very minute. Find them,
return them to me, and your payment will be well, my very savings.

I'm working on an experiment, of an enchantment variety. However, I have this
nasty tendency to lose things. My moon sigil went missing when I was shopping
at the Moonlight Mall, ironic yes, a simple stone but important for the
artificing that I am working with. The sun sigil seemed to vanish when I was
riding the ferry. Don't know where it could be now. The starlight sigil,
well that got lost somewhere in Tarislar when I was looking for the Masonic
lodge that used to be out there. Anyways, gather these up for me, bring them 
here, and I'll pay you well. Thanks for your time.

Got a bit of a job going, looks like your line of work.~
Can't do it? Sorry to hear.~
Alright. I'll hire someone else.~
You did good, I will put out a good word for you.~
A few years back, a scientist named Dr. Bradley used to work with
Saeder-Krupp. Well, he relocated, and took his research with him to his new
employers who are paying far better in both salary and in research funds. So
he's happy where he's at. However, Saeder Krupp decided somewhere in their
management that they deserved his most current research because he was once
their employee. A team of shadowrunners struck the plant that he was working
at, nearly killing him and two other scientists, and stole two parts of a
prototypical particle accelerator. Saeder Krupp's smart, they did not leave
the whole thing in their Tarislar compound, they hired some researchers from
Shintaru to examine the other part of it. Either way, we want the complete
item back, and will pay handsomely for it.

A noble from Tir Tairngire is planning on giving a speech at Seattle Center on

Someone, someone whom I agreed to arrange this meet for, wants him dead,
before he can make his speech and meet with Lindstrom. I don't know why, but
this person does not want him to make the announcement he plans to make. If
you geek him, and save this person the headache he fears, you will be paid
quite well. Kill his bodyguards as well. My sponsor doesn't want them going to
the Tir and sponsoring an investigation.

Someone with an eye on the Tarislar neighborhood is quite offended with the

My traffic routes are being compromised by a gang moving into the area. The
highway 229 route is the one that concerns me most. This gang, called the
Ancients, are no more than a bunch of upstarts who take orders from one of the
upstarts sitting in the Council of Princes in Tir Tairngire. The job is quite
simple. Someone who isn't affiliated with a gang that has signed a treaty
with the gangs in which I am allied with, someone like you, would be excellent
for this job. The people I need...well...killed, to put it bluntly, go by
these names. Sting. Tiny. Green Lucifer. And any of their lackeys. But
mainly those three are who concern me. I can not allow them to monopolize
the highway 229 route, as they so wish to. They already control the I-5
corridor's...shipping, and if they take highway 229 as well, I'm out of
business. I hope you understand my predicament.

Excellent... Here is your reward.~
Terthiene Veladrana, a friend of mine, wishes to expand our business in the
Gresham area, down in Tir Tairngire. However, he needs an escort into Tir
Tairngire, through the border. His old visas have expired, but he has a
contact on the inside that will restore it once he can regain contact with
this individual. Anyways, take him to an office, in Gresham, east off of
Cleveland. It's a plain office, and the person who keeps it up usually has
jazz music playing there. Gresham is quite difficult to get to, but an
automobile will attract too much attention from people who are watching this
place closely. One more thing before I let you go... There is a group of
people who wish to see him dead. If you run into them, be sure to shoot first
and ask questions later.

I heard some grave news from a friend of mine working inside of Aztechnology
as a wage mage. He learned of a ritual that is being cast, for "research".
The thing is, that it includes blood magic, and this magic is to summon a very
powerful metaplanar being to be bound as an ally. At the waterfall inside the
Aztechnology magical research academy, is where he is going to do this
horrible ritual. This run is tough, and involves some wetwork, but it is for
the better, and when you see what is going on you will believe me. I need you
to kill the sorceror behind this project, a Joaquin Riviera, and banish (kill)
the demonic creature he is trying to bring into the world. Then I want you to
destroy all the materials he used, a dagger and a magical circle. When you are
through, place this sigil I gave you at the location, to purify it, lest any
more....creatures of that variety come through. This is urgent. This is
dangerous. But it must be done.

missile guidance system. The plans are in the hands of an executive of

by an encryption key. Kill him and bring me the secretary. Behind his office

A daughter of someone very important in my organization has been kidnapped and

have done nothing to deserve the kind of reward they are demanding, so I wish
to hire you to extract her from the situation. She is being held by a grisly
sociopath who is known as the Teddy Bear Killer. I fear for her life. I want
you to go in and get her out of there alive. Bring her to the corner of

I have an extraction job for you.~
Aww, its okay, I'll find somebody else.~
Ouch. A failure. That's not going to look good to others in my biz.~
Great!~
Avery Holmes used to work for Ares back in the 2050's, until he got a
seemingly good deal from Telestrian. Well, the deal has become far more than
he wished to stomach, and he wants to hitch a ride back to Seattle. He works
in the Utility Levels, lowest one I think, that's the place where they do all
the engineering work for the public section of the Habitat. Anyways, escort
him out of the Telestrian Habitat, and take him to Dante's Inferno, that's
this club up north in Seattle, pretty big slottin' deal up there. Go down to
where an asian executive by the name of Miyoko sits, its a private room with
white noise doodads, you won't miss it. There may be some Telestrian or
Aquilor black ops along the way wanting to geek him. If they try, geek them
instead. Guard Avery's life with yours.

Excellent.~
Telestrian is working on a project, called "Project Romulus" which involves a
nuclear reaction focused to precision with a special crystal, which can not be
made through any means of common knowledge. Well the Romulus Crystal has been
developed and is currently in use in the Utility Levels of the Telestrian
Habitat. Armand Tourval is overseeing the project, a very respected executive
with much clout in the corporation. Well, the complete information on how to
create a Romulus array, and the focusing crystals, is with Mr. Tourval. This
is wizzer technology, even more SOTA than what is considered SOTA by nearly
everyone. (-SOTA = state of the art). My sponsor, Miyoko, an executive who
works for my sponsoring corporation, wants the chip and the crystal delivered
to him, at any cost. As I said, its a big job, but big jobs pay big.

You are a first rate shadowrunner.~
Several years ago, the Renraku Arcology was shut down, due to the actions of a
powerful AI that was developed there, as the Arcology Expert Program, or AEP.
The AI, known commonly today as Deus, wreaked massive havoc inside, enslaving
the population and brainwashing them to loyalty. The most important players
in the development of the AEP are still alive, and still have their positions
on the inside, being "satisfactorily rehabilitated" according to Renraku's
central leadership. Corben Lucifer, the computer scientist who extracted the
AI algorithms from the AI named Morgan and patched them into the AEP still
works inside, Sherman Huang, who was proven to be a loyal drone for Deus still
holds the position of Director of the Seattle Renraku subsidiaries, and Michael
Dumont, who was captain of the "Blue" level drones for Deus, and had done much
of his dirty work before he was "satisfactorily rehabilitated."  I want you to
go in and kill them. I have reason to believe they still serve Deus on some
level and history will repeat. I have strong evidence. I didn't want it to
come to this.

Heh heh... Trixter will be pleased.~
Security of a small company, Electric Communications has been audited by a
"freelance security consultant", a decker named Trixter. He found a hole in
their systems and now he wishes to show the company who has been exploited
exactly what was exploited and how to fix it. Its an odd job, really, but it
is easy. Go to the Ketcham Building in Tacoma, its on Moreland, where the
Knight-Errant guards are, and deliver this note and this disk to the system
adminstrator on the third floor. He won't like what he reads, but perhaps he
needs a little downgrade to his ego. And be nice when you go into the
building, don't be wearing no armor or weapons, or else Knight-Errant will
think you are a threat and treat you accordingly. When you have used this key
and are finished with the job, destroy it before you come back to me.

gangsters. And they aren't here in Seattle, you will have to go to Portland

Excellent, you may have a future with us. Go find a man named Hermes, ask him about his chain.~
An associate of mine, an executive for the Morningstar Enchantments
corporation, asked me to find people for him to do a difficult task. A set of
very important relics have been stolen from a prominent mage who works with
them, ancient relics of elven origin. Anyways, one of them is a necklace,
with a triangle made of orichalcum, and the other is a ring made of a
substance much like silver. A datastore was also physically stolen by this
person, an agent I believe to have Aztechnology connections, an optical glass
"brick" for storing large amounts of data. It contains encrypted information
regarding magical rituals. He told me that he believes that it will be used
in a sacriligious manner, and have negative consequences on a large scale.
Pick up this ring, the optical data unit, and the triangle necklace, if there
is a mage using them in Aztechnology, you may have to kill him. Deliver these
items to an executive for Morningstar who will wait for you at the Moonlight
Mall, at the fountain.

That's one less vampire coven to deal with.~
There's something brewing under Redmond...in fact, what's going on is that the

have many allies in these tunnels, ghouls, and such, and an old serial killer
to boot. Well, I need you to clean house on the vampires. These vampires are
nearly immune to just about any sort of ballistic weapon, so guns will do no
good. A blade, or blunt object is best for this task, or perhaps a Physical
Adept's killing hands. Their leader is a vampire named Hemorrhage. Kill him
too.

I've got something that needs to be taken down to the Caribbean, you've got a League Visa, right?~
Shame, chummer.~
Null persp, chummer. I got someone else waitin on this job if you don't want it.~
Well done, this has proven to be a wonderful investment.~
First and foremost, I hope you have a Caribbean League approved visa, because
you're gonna have to head down to Grenada for me. Pretty simple, so here's
what you're gonna do. Take these templates up to Everett and hop the first
flight you can down to Grenada, to the city of Sauteurs. Once there, make your
way to The Montplaisir Restaurant, where you'll meet up with my associate,
Mister Who. Give em the templates and then book back up here to Seattle to
collect your dough, easy enough, right?

I've got a retrieval job in the Caribbean scheduled.~
Another time, maybe.~
Null sweat, chummer. Someone else'll finish the job~
Good job on the retrieval.~
This bit of legwork will involve having to catch a flight down to the
Caribbean League, in particular, to the island of Grenada. I have an associate
who is interested in smuggling a piece of information back up to the good old
UCAS, but it's currently sitting halfway across the globe. That's where you
come in. An informant from the Victoria police station will be leaving a
canister of microfilm in an abandoned lot nearby the precinct, which is on the
southwestern side of the city of Victoria. Your task is simple, retrieve the
canister of microfilm and bring it back to me. Easy enough, right?
