This is one of the El'nigre clan members. As like the yellow ones these elfs
don't like anyone. They are basicly the same as the Yellow gangers but can
cause more damage, for they are more trained and know more about combat. The
Azure coloring on them indicates they are of power in the El'nirge circle,
they can dictate what happens in daily life. But they are not the most
powerful.
