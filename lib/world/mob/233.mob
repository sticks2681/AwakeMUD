This drone is an Artificial Combat Intelligence, or ACI for short. Due to

This is the epitome of Chinese military ingenuity, or more specifically,
WuXing military ingenuity. The Black Guards are essentially brainwashed trogs,
having spent years in training before ever being allowed to walk the floors of
WuXing corporate buildings. The famous general, known only as Lu Bu, designed
the program a few years after WuXing's conception. Nobody has complained since
- except for the unfortunate runners who meet the edge of their axes.

RoomDesc:$
Lu Bu the Black Guard General scans security monitors innumerable. 

~
LookDesc:$
He's one giant trog, that's for sure. Sticking out from his mouth and between
his nicotine stained teeth is an enormous cigar. His eyes are covered by a
pair of mirrored aviator sunglasses, and he wears a black suit with a white
tie. The suit itself must be a few sizes too large, as you notice armor
plating causing the expensive piece of formal wear to jut in various spots.
The armor obscures his muscles, however...there's no way of knowing how tough
this guy is.

Name:	Jimmy Bonanno
RoomDesc:$
A fat man in a dark suit sits here, stuffing his face. 

~
LookDesc:$
This is the brother of the infamous Don Bonanno of Tacoma - and given the
honorary title of the "Enforcer of Protection." Translated, it means he spends
a lot of time shaking down stores across the metroplex and surrounding areas,
forcing them to cough up hundreds of thousands of 'yen to the mob.

A black shadow leaps at you!

LookDesc:$
He blends so well into the darkness it is hard to tell just who he might be. A
pair of glinting metal dog tags hang around his neck, and a glimmering sword
edge appears to be slowly moving in your general direction.

A small chinese boy is here, crying excruciatingly loud for his mother.

He can't be much older than six or seven years, but his cry seems to shudder
the entire building with a piercing sound that could break glass easily. In
fact, you wonder if it already has.
