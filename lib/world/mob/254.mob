An ork missing a tusk tends the bar here. 

~
LookDesc:$
This rough looking orkish bastard appears to have been in his fair share of
scrapes and scuffles, as evident by all the scars and other various
superficial injuries... Or wait.. maybe he's just ugly? It's a bit hard to
tell, especially with the dermal deposits that pock mark his skin at random.
One of his tusks has been broken clean off, though it does seem like he's
tried to sand it down so it doesn't snag on anything, which leaves his face
looking kind of lopsided.

This rough looking little bastard has been around the block more than enough

That's right, she is an ork manager of Crusher 495, not -the- manager. The
reason why is due to the fact that the establishment was the brain child of
roughly a dozen orks, who put their heads together and decided to create an
atmosphere where any and all metatypes can coalesce under one room and enjoy a
drink and meal. She is built like most orks, and if it weren't for the
blatantly obvious rack on this dame, you would have sworn she was a man. Her
tusks are carefully cleaned and covered in a coat of what appears to be a
clear nail polish, giving them an extra bit of shine.

Well, if you didn't know any better, you'd assume this ork just got off of his

exposure, so he's probably in his mid to late twenties (oh, that's right..
that'd make him an OLD ork). He's sporting a dirty janitors outfit marked with
an occasional grease stain, which bears a nametag that reads, "Melvin" across
the breast.

Stalwart is a polite way of pointing out this guy is the stereotypical
nightmare fuel of Humanis everywhere. He's almost as wide as he is tall, and
man oh man, is he tall. Large ram-like horns curl over themselves and create a
helmet, which only further serves to give him an appearance of one bad mother
fragger. He's a bit cross-eyed as well, so it gives him this weird, crazy
aura, making him appear more menancing than he probably is... Then again,
considering the size of the baseball bat hefted over his shoulder, maybe you
SHOULD judge a book by its cover.

You'll have to assume this is the bartender around these parts, namely because
he's set up shop behind the remnants of what was once a spiffy synthwood bar
counter. His choice in dress is a bit odd, but certainly not when you take a
glance around, it might even be tame by those standards. He wears a stained
and ripped one-piece jumpsuit you'd find on most janitors, its name tag long
since ripped off, thread from its seams still sticking out and frayed. Over
his head he appears to be wearing an old burlap sack, which has eye holes
crudely cut out, along with a small slit for his mouth. Around his neck is a
old piece of rope, wound around to help keep his mask on.

little to hide all the wrinkles he has from living a life of constant drug

While he may not be high in the ranks of the gang, he certainly has gained a
fair amount of notoriety as being a tough customer amongst his peers and
enemies alike. He gained his nickname due to the old injury to his jaw, which
left him somewhat disfigured and added another chip on his shoulder. Word on
the street is if you make a habit of staring at his injury, he returns the
favour by giving you one of your own for others to gawk at.

Calling him heavyset is probably the most polite way of putting it, since the

a tiny nub, while the other protrudes and curves almost up to touch his face

A creepy guy is here in the corner. 

~
LookDesc:$
Sure, he's a stalker, but that doesn't mean he's a bad guy, right? He's
just... passionate? Passionate about stalking that is. He's quite optimistic
about the whole affair, and a bit too cheerful, which probably explains his
nickname. Unlike other amateurs, he's honed the fine art of stalking unknowing
victims. His favourite past times including: Stalking, more stalking, and
macrame.

Ok, so he's short, he's Korean after all. Got a problem with it? Aside from

One glance is all you need to determine this guy is in with a criminal
syndicate, his appearance and dress all but screams it. He's wearing a dirty
wife beater, a headband, camouflage pants and combat boots. There's also the
little detail on his headband that lends this assumption credence, it's a
black wolf's head with the Korean word for "Honor" written on its forehead in
white. They're unmistakably Komun'go Seoulpa Ring colours. Word on the street
is Hyeon Sang-chul here has more than just a few ties with them.

Much larger and deadlier than their devil rat counterparts, these byproducts
of SURGE are known as demon rats, and for good reason. This one in particular
appears to be quite the specimen, its squat body is a bundle of thick muscle,
and its flabby, pale white scabrous hide has only a few sporadic tufts of fur
growing from it. Its eyes glow a dull red, and its pair of gnarly front teeth
are the size of an orks hand. It strolls around like it owns the place, most
likely because it does.

The Grand Wizard's bodyguard is keeping an eye peeled. 

~
LookDesc:$
Decked out in milispec gear and chromed to the gills, it's clear they didn't
take any short cuts or spare any expense when outfitting these guys. They look
more like special forces operatives than bodyguards, and their appearances
likely match the set of skills they have at their disposal. Only a fool would
underestimate their prowess in combat, which is matched by their righteous
fervor and zealotry to the cause.

Standing tall enough to be an entire head and shoulders in height above most
trolls, and weighing in at in excess of five hundred some odd pounds of pure
ugly. This minotaur's face is covered in old scars and his muzzle has more
scar tissue than the local burn ward. He's called Mad Bull Watts, for obvious
reasons, not to mention he's a psychopath that sees red when he's upset, so
good luck trying to talk some sense into him. He sports a gaudy gold nose ring
to round out the look, since it seems to be mandatory attire for minotaurs.

There's really no other way to describe this ork than "Fraggin' Ugly". He
takes the cake, along the candles in that department alone, and he doesn't
look too bright considering the perpetual look of pure stupid, or maybe that's
just the face he was born with. His nickname is Chiggers, which is taken from
the parasite of the same name, partly due to his sickly red skin colour, and
partly because he's the worst kind of parasite. One of his tusks is mostly
rotten and has taken on an almost black colour due to blatant neglect.

Mr. Cleveland Deleon is laying here, waiting for the masseuse. 

~
LookDesc:$
Better known in the business as "Cut-Throat Cleveland", this nickname was
given to him by associates due to his tenacity and mercilessness, though most
aren't aware of how suiting this nickname actually is. He doesn't seem to have
a care in the world as he relaxes and waits on the masseuse, the only thing on
his mind being what he'll be having for dinner after this appointment.

A cybernetically enhanced bodyguard has taken up his post here. 

~
LookDesc:$
There's no mistake what he's on the payroll for, that much is obvious from a
simple glance. He's sporting more ware and chrome than most runners you'll
bump into in the shadows, and from the look in his eyes, which are high
quality cyber replacements, he's serious about doing his job to the letter.
Even the smallest of his movements are fluid and unnaturally smooth, and it
doesn't seem that much is likely to slip past him unnoticed.

While he may not be sporting heavy ware like his associate, it's doubtful that
he requires them. The talismans and trinkets he has pinned to his clothing,
along with the various rings and jewelry, not to mention the almost blatantly
arrogant demeanor he has, indicate that he's most likely a hermetic mage. When
you can bend the universe to your whim, why wouldn't you be arrogant?

Upon first glance it would be hard to peg this conservatively dressed man as a
criminal, in fact, he looks like he'd be more at home in a cubicle farm or
behind an executive desk. His clothing is clean and pressed, but it isn't
flashy and he lacks any kind of jewelry. He is groomed to perfectly and seems
to take quite a bit of pride in that fact, which is made evident by the way in
which he carries himself. Looks can be deceiving, of course, because Shen
Dahzong is better known on the streets as "Shen Gui", which roughly translates
as "Shen the Devil", the go-to guy the Yellow Lotus Triad uses whenever they
need to teach someone a lesson in etiquette.

mostly because she's a ruthless killer in the employ of the Yellow Lotus
Triad. Her good looks and bubbly personality disguise this fact nicely, which
makes her all the more effective at her job.
