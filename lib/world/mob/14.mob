RoomDesc:$
A huge troll in a suit stands here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Huge boils with throbbing yellow heads cover almost all of his exposed skin
area; his large horns and tusks rip jaggedly through his dark brown skin. Both
of his blue eyes are bloodshot and yellow-tinged. Despite all this, he's
dressed in a very nice suit.

RoomDesc:$
A Ghoul wearing Camos and a Black and Yellow sash stands here 

~
LookDesc:$
A Ghoul soldier from the african Nation of Asamundo stands here with his AK-97
held securely in his clawed hands. One might think that a ghoul would be a
horrible shot due to having no sight but those who have fought a Asamundo
warrior know that they are some of the deadliest hand to hand fighters around
as well as being decent shots. He may have no sight but his magical hearing
and scent more than make up for it. Black tribal tattoos dance across his pale
grey skin and create a intricate design on his bald head. Tucked into a pair
of sleek black combat boots he carries a mono-edged combat knife. His belt
carries extra clips for the AK and a few Thermite grenades.

RoomDesc:$
A white-furred Wendigo wearing Trogs colors stands here.

LookDesc:$
Before you stands a nine-foot-tall white furred Wendigo. He's wearing black
and red biker leathers and has a hellhound cloak draped over his shoulders.
Each of the fingers on his large hands are tipped with an extremely long and
deadly looking claw. The most intimidating things about him though are the
bent up, razor-sharp, blood-stained teeth in his huge mouth. He wears no
boots, revealing toes also tipped with a deadly looking claws. Despite this
ferocious appearance, his eyes are a warm brown color and he seems to be
friendly enough for a HMHVV-infected ork.
