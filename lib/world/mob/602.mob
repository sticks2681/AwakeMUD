a large ^rred^N fox with ^Wwhite^N tufted fur is inspecting the area here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Its a plain ^rred^N fox, aside from the fact its much larger than any other fox
you've seen before. It bears ^Wwhite^N tufts bordered with thin ^Lblack bands^N atop
its triangular ears and the tip of its tail, while its paws are solid ^Lblack^N in
colour below the ankles. Its ears are perked high, as if having caught a sound
of interest, and it seems to be inspecting the area atop the roof vigilantly.

This grizzly is simply massive, it makes even the largest of trolls look like
ragdolls. Rough and weathered ^ybrown^N fur  covers it from head to claw, whose
somewhat fluffy nature beguiles the tank-like physique and muscle structure
beneath, which is hinted to at its large, thick shoulders as it moves around.
He mosies along like he hasn't a worry in the world, then again, why would he
be worried about anything?

The first thing you notice is how extremely short he is, and the second would
be the slick suit hes sporting, for a little guy hes got some style. He has
somewhat broad shoulders, but overall his stature is diminutive at best, which
is highlighted even more as he sits behind the massive wooden desk set up
here. A fairly large cigar is always present in his lips, and he never even
removes it, even when hes speaking, and the ash on it continues to grow
treacherously long in the meanwhile. All in all, the best way to describe him
would be... a miniature mobster. Word on the street is that he has ties to the
Genovese family, and in turn is a made man. It would be wise not to tangle
with this little guy, for your own safety.

that most people simply back down rather than risk a bout of fisticuffs (or
worse) with him. He speaks very little, and instead prefers letting his body

Name:	a paranoid looking man in a trenchcoat
RoomDesc:$
A paranoid looking man in a trenchcoat waits impatiently here. 

~
LookDesc:$
He's decked out in a dull grey trenchcoat and dark sunglasses and looks
extremely uneasy, his gaze perpetually moving from side to side as he takes in
his surroundings. Hes obviously waiting for something, but its hard to tell
what, but by the location and the scenery, its probably safe to say its
something unsavory.

Name:	a fat italian man
RoomDesc:$
A fat italian man sits here, eating a spaghetti dinner. 

~
LookDesc:$
This italian man is about as tall as he is wide, and is sweating profusely,
since apparently his girth made simple tasks like eating a physical effort.
Hes dressed in a fairly nice suit, although hes missing his jacket and has his
undershirt unbuttoned to help cool himself off. Hes currently digging into a
spaghetti and meatball dinner, almost completely unaware of his surroundings
as he enjoys his meal.

RoomDesc:$
A bodyguard dressed in a black suit stands at attention here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Hes tall, for starters, and sports a tidy black suit along with a pair of dark
sunglasses, making the attention of his gaze hard to determine. Hes obviously
a bodyguard, and doing his best impression of a secret service agent, complete
with the silent, stoic body posturing and demeanor. Hes also well armed, so be
careful.
