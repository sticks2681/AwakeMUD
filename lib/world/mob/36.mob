Name:	Cain
RoomDesc:$
Cain looks you over.

~
LookDesc:$
The massive troll who stands before you is a unique, if not terrifying, sight.
His obviously sculpted muscles bulge when he moves, and move he does.  His quick
movements infer to you that his neurons have had a little cyber boosted.  The
most unusual thing about Cain isn't his lack of weapons, but his clothing. Cain
wears only a leather loincloth...bolted to his waist.

Keywords:	Overlord Red Dragon Lieutenant
Name:	Overlord
RoomDesc:$
Overlord examines you but dismisses you as a threat.

~
LookDesc:$
Overlord is the controlling lieutenant for the Red Dragons.  His closely cropped
hair and trim body are the remnants from his military days.  Overlord is not
a outwardly powerful person.  Yet, he does command respect.  And the other Red
Dragons obey, often with deadly results.

RoomDesc:$
Johnny Boy is here pretending that he can dance.

~
LookDesc:$
Never seen without his Iron Legion apparel, Johnny Boy is next in command under
Overlord.  His tall lanky body makes this orc appear rather scrawny, but you
know that if he has reached this rank in the Iron Legion he can hold his own.

Keywords:	Sigmund Red Dragon trainer teacher
Name:	Sigmund
RoomDesc:$
Sigmund looks over you as he hums a phat tune. 

~
LookDesc:$
The immense scaly body of Sigmund puts you in awe.  As you sweep you gaze over
to him he raises up on his hind legs and stands at least 15 meters tall.  One
horn has been broken off of his head and the other is twisted into an
unnatural gnarled twirl.  His tail is at least 13 meters longs and sweeps back
and forth over the stone floor raking small clouds of granite dust as it goes.
Sigmund slowly beats his wings to steady himself on his back legs as he look
over you. A huge gold chain hangs around his neck, a large dollar symbol
attached to it, swinging casually from his movement. A black and white bandana
is wrapped around his head, and he shoots you a gang sign.

Ivil Krushya is here plotting.

~
LookDesc:$
A terror to all around him.  Ivil is the main tactician for the Red Dragons.
It is up to Ivil to decide when, where, and what the Dragons attack.  Although
only a human, Ivil has a powerful build that leads back to his Russian
heritage.  He peers at you from behind chromed cybereyes and a small smile is
visible beneath his heavy greying beard and mustache.
