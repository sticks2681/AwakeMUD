Name:	a crusty old boat captain
RoomDesc:$
A crusty old boat captain is at the helm, in just as bad of shape as his ship.

~
LookDesc:$
He's obviously a crusty old barge captain, that much is obvious. He's sporting
a ragged and stained navy sea coat, which is covered in ashes from his
constantly smoking corncob pipe. His hair (or what's left of it), sticks out
of the sides from beneath his captains cap.

LookDesc:$
This absolutely massive aquatic lizard has nine seperate meter and a half long
heads perched upon tree trunk thick necks, each of their maws filled to the
brim with serrated teeth the size of gardening trowels. The chitinous scales
that cover its hulking form shift and fade along its length from dirty
yellowish green along its back and spine, to an underbelly a greyish colour of
an overcast sky. Its rear legs end in flipper like paddles, which it puts to
good use while in the water, making it faster than most ships. Its forelimbs
are lizard like, with webbed feet and formidable claws that could easily rend
a man in twain.
