Name:	a young, attractive woman
RoomDesc:$
Jessica Thorp stands here behind a large reception desk 

~
LookDesc:$
Sharply dressed in a stylish Armani executive's skirt, this woman commands
attention.  Tall and attractive, her body fills the curves in her tailored
suit perfectly. Her long, slender legs seem to go on forever and her bare
calves have a flawless, soft creamy tone.  Her long raven black hair is held
off her shoulders in a professional up-do, carefully styled so the ends of her
straight silky hair flow down just to tease the tips of her shoulders, and
your eyes. Her delicate facial features and gracefully slender neck add to her
femininity while her sharp, crystal blue eyes give her an air of strength and
authority.

Keywords:	charels vent male man human charley
Name:	Charles Vent
RoomDesc:$
A large, burly-looking human hangs out here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Large and burly are, without question to anyone who knows him, understatements
when referring to good ol' Charles Vent. Especially burly, his gruff demeanor
leaves one wondering how he ever got a gig dealing with customers in any way,
shape, or form. However, the wares he sells suggest it is a matter of HAVING
to deal with Charley rather than wanting to. Some say he has contacts with
various armed forces and despite his gruff, hostile attitude; he does go out
of his way to make sure everyone he deals with is properly equipped.

Name:	Fast Eddie
RoomDesc:$
a lean, hearty looking elf stands behind the counter waiting to feed you 

~
LookDesc:$
This lean looking elf stands behind the ordering counter waiting take your
order. He's got a sly grin on his face as if someone just told him a joke.
Everyone has taken to calling him Fast Eddie generally because he gets your
order to you in no time at all, and because he drives a slick Westwind Turbo
to make his various 'deliveries'. Rumour has it, Fast Eddie is related to the
owners of Rocco's Pizza in Portland, judging by the pizza he serves, that
rumour may well be true.
