Dressed to the nines in Vashon Island corporate wear, he may not be corporate

walking to his Toyota Elite, parked in one of the parking structures in this

A woman in an executive skirt, blouse, and jacket rushes through here.

LookDesc:$
She looks like she works real hard to get paid real well.  Gold plated rimmed
glasses, Armante blouse and skirt, and a briefcase with golden buckles, make
for her outfit.  Snazzy.  In her mind, anyways.  She is in a rush, as she
probably doesn't take public transportation, and she certainly wouldn't sit in
one of those nasty cabs with the dope fiend driver.  She's rushing to her car.
