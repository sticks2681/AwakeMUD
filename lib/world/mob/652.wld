Name:	A Vacant Parking Lot
Desc:$
   The wind whips across the gravel graveyard, kicking dust and litter against
old, rusted-out car shells. The few still-operable vehicles here probably
belong to the occupants of the old, one-level brick warehouse to the north.
While most of the structure seems deserted, its windows boarded over and its
walls graffiti-filled, the center portion sports a sturdy metal door,
surrounded by lit windows with fresh panes of glass in them. A tilted neon
sign above the door identifies this establishment as The Gentleman Loser.  A
large garage door occupies the northeastern corner of the building, and the
intersection of Seneca and Ninth is to the northwest.

Name:	The Gentleman Loser
Desc:$
   Recessed ceiling lights cast a hazy golden glow over the large main room of
The Gentleman Loser. The mingled smells of tobacco and beer hang in the air,
despite the best efforts of the air filtration vents over head. The synthwood
walls and genuine hardwood floor are worn smooth with age. A few synthwood
tables and chairs occupy the center of the room and a worn pool table and a
rack of cues sit in the northwest corner, near a fancy looking wooden door. A
spotless synthwood bar occupies most of the eastern wall, with the usual
mirrored shelves and trideo unit behind it, mounted to the ceiling in the
northeast corner. A small raised platform in the southeast corner acts as a
stage for the occassional live musician. A short hallway is to the north, and
the exit to the parking lot is to the south.

   The wall of this short, dimly-lit hallway are plastered with faded posters
for long-past concerts and sporting events. You even manage to catch sight of
an old ^Y2600^N meeting poster.  The air seems clearer here, and the sounds from
the bar are fairly muffled.  The ladies' room is to the west, the men's room
east, and an unmarked, sturdy-looking synthwood door occupies the north wall.

According to this 2600 meeting poster, there's supposed to be a meeting at the
food court in the Espanoza Way Complex at sometime.  You can't exactly tell
what's written after that because it's been faded out and is nothing more than
a blur on the paper.

sits in the center of the room, surrounded by several metal folding chairs.  A
small shelf runs the length of the south wall, a few ashtrays and empty
glasses occupying its surface. The majority of the north wall is taken up by a
large whiteboard.  The small switch next to it presumably activates the white
noise generator mounted in plain sight directly over the poker table.

a makeshift door has been constructed with a very high tech security lock on
it.  Towards your east is another doorway back into the hallway.

northwest corner, revealing their contents; mini-rockets, grenades, shurikens.
This place is a gun nuts dream, and only the most loyal of folk get access to

system has been implemented just beyond of the bulletproof glass, and it's
currently off.  There's a switch near the hole in the security wall that you
