An older man stands here, pistol in hand.

You can tell by the countless scars and distrustful glare that Kiol
is, or was at one point, a shadowrunner.  And a surviving runner is a
successful one.

RoomDesc:$
Duuness is fencing with his distorted shadow.

~
LookDesc:$
Wearing a long navy cape, with his combat axe leaning next to a nearby chair
and his Ares Monofilament sword in his hand, Duuness appears to be a modern
version of a Dark Age knight.

Name:	Feng Shui
RoomDesc:$
A muscular Japanese man surveys the room. 

~
LookDesc:$
Bioware would be the instant assumption upon spying this man's physique,
however its never obvious.  His hair is jet-black and oiled into a neat
ponytail, pulled away from his face entirely.  Clear oriental features mark
him as a typical Japanese, tho the scar that carves its way from his hair line
and down across his left eye is surely to have a very interesting story behind
it indeed.

RoomDesc:$
An tall, elegant woman observes the room with intelligent eyes. 

~
LookDesc:$
Oriental features are smoothed by the pale tone of her face. Gentle over all,
she has a certain elegance to her stance, a perceived superiority in the way
she holds herself. Dressed in a beautiful silk dress styled akin to a
traditional Japanese kimono, the royal blues and regal reds compliment the
obsidian shine of her hair.
