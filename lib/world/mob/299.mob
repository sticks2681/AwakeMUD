Name:	Barney
RoomDesc:$
A rather plump fixer stands here, dealing weapons out of the back of his van.

~
LookDesc:$
Yuck, he's wearing a stained, greasy shirt that looks a few sizes too small
for him.  He puts down his steak burger as you approach.

Keywords:	man manager suit
Name:	the manager
RoomDesc:$
A man in a suit sits behind the desk, silently filling out some paperwork. 

~
LookDesc:$
A fairly nondescrip suit, this middle aged white man seems content filling in
the veritable mountain of forms piled up on his desk.  His black hair is
parted in such a way that it attempts to conceal his rapidly receding
hairline, but fails miserably.  It shines with greasy gel goodness.
