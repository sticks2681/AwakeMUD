RoomDesc:$
Senator Briza - minority leader of the council - is standing here. 

~
LookDesc:$
You see a ebony skinned elven female. She goes by the name of Briza. You
wonder if you haven't seen her face already a few times somewhere else, and
then it rings a bell: This is THE Briza. She was one of the most feared
runners and later joined some other group. Now it is claimed that she has
quite some influence in both government and megacorps. There were many rumours
about her also being a powerful magic being, even sayings that she is
proficient in shamanism, so it never was apparent what totem she would follow.

What should a waitress look like? It is just this very face that you wouldn't
recognize again, this one like a million. She is dressed with some white
clothing that just seems to be messed up by some sauces and other stuff you
even wouldn't like to know.
