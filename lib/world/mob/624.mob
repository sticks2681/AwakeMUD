A manager for Pelagie Waterfront Apartments is watching the trid here.

LookDesc:$
This rather young gentleman appears to be in charge of the apartment complex,
which isn't really much of a complex. He munches loudly on his current snack
of choice as he watches the small trideo set on his desk, occasionally
glancing up when someone arrives to see if they need any help. If you wish to
rent out a boat house, it seems this is the guy to talk about it with.
