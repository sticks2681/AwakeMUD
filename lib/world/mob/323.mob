A large elf dressed in black leather stands here, watching the door. 

~
LookDesc:$
This man is rather large and muscular for an elf. He has a handsome but
serious face, and spiked blonde hair. He is wearing a tight black leather
shirt which details the muscles on his torso and a pair of black leather
pants. Draped across his chest over the shirt are two criss-crossing chains
that appear to be made from silver.  Dressed head to toe in black leather and
chains, this man's image and outward appearance scream 'bouncer'.

The bartender is tall and stunningly beautiful in that stereotypical elven
way, but really makes her stand out is the rare pearly, iridescent skin tone
constrasting with her long black hair. She's dressed in tight latex pants and
a gauzy shirt pulled so tight across her chest it fails to conceal anything.
Though it's hard to get much of a look as she moves from one end of the bar to
the other filling glasses and serving drinks.

they catch a stray sound. It certainly didn't look friendly, by any means, but
they certainly made one hell of a guard dog, reinforced by the fact that each
one of the heads sported a thick ^Lblack leather^N collar with an emblazoned
letter ^L'^WV^L'^N done in ^Wsilver^N, so apparently the creature is someones pet.

looking human known only as 'Wild Bill'. Last but not least, the only ork
member of the band, Charles 'Brick Fist' Langston, is also one of the most

Underground, and probably the entire metroplex itself.

This entire band consists of a single entity, Quincy Duran, who was once a
normal elf like any other. As a child he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD), by his tenth birthday he was confined to a wheelchair, and by
age fourteen he was completely paralyzed. In lieu of being confined to a
hospital bed for the rest of his life, as short as it would have been in that
state, he opted for a complete biopod conversion. He now lives his life inside
of a reinforced steel and ballistic glass canopic jar, which holds his brain,
central nervous system, a fair amount of bone marrow, chunks of liver, pieces
of kidney and a variety of glands supported in an aqueous solution of
preprocessed nutrient-rich fluids. This would keep most people from living any
sort of successful or fulfilling life, but instead, it opened the door for new
possibilities. With his hefty datajack, VCR, variable simsense and synthlink
cyberware, he can share his musical genius with others.

around like tufts of fur in the wind, giving it a very fearsome appearance,
not to mention its jaw strength could easily crush every single bone in your
body with little effort. This fearsome predator has been known to tackle the
largest of foes and defend its territory even when alone and outnumbered, its
safe to assume why it makes such a good guard dog. With the scents of every
authorized personel member in its system, unless directed otherwise it will
immediately attack any trespassers.
