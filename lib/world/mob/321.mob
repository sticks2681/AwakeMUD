Name:	a suspicious character
RoomDesc:$
A suspicious-looking man stands here with an odd bulge under his jacket. 

~
LookDesc:$
This character looks pretty short, hunched over in his tan trenchcoat, hands
hiding underneath the cloth.  He's bald, and his eyes are a pale green, with
that crazy look in them as he shies away from you.  He elicits that feeling of
a little rodent who always skitters and hides...and chews through your gas
lines.

RoomDesc:$
A somewhat short, overweight, middle aged man stands here, leaning on a cane.

~
LookDesc:$
A rather short individual, middle aged, with a bit of a paunch on him.  He is
more or less bald, and the hair he has remaining is starting to grey around
the edges.  He wears a white suit with a fashionable fedora hat in the same
color and a black band around the base.  In one hand he has a cane, and he has
a white overcoat to complete his ensemble.  His eyes betray a spark of extreme
intelligence, and he speaks with a slight accent of someone from the eastern
seaboard.  He also has an aura...a dangerous feeling about him.

This fellow has the look that just screams 'Johnson'.  Short-cropped black
hair, a poker face that the boys in Vegas would love, and a business attire

and age, but looks toned enough to make a safe assumption he works out in the
executive gym on a daily basis.
