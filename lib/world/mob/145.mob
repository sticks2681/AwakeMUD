A gigantic Joker Spirit hovers above, staring at you silently.

Enflamed in blue waves of astral and physical power, the Joker controls almost
all of his minions via an immense astral network that anchors the subjects
mind to the Joker's. From here, he controls all of his major operations, while
his second-hand men handle the smaller jobs. Smuggling, trade, deals, and
takeovers all run rife in the Joker's world. As these thoughts fly by before
you even see his face, you are suddenly whipped back into reality. An
elongated, bony face rides just over a purple velvet robe, the skin dark black
in the recesses, and a pale ebony hue to the rest. Streaks of black and red
dart down in a teardrop pattern over his cheeks. However, as usual, it's his
eyes that worry you. How many people do you know that have totally black eyes?
