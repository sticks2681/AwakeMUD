lower body is covered in matted fur of a sickly brown color splotches of gray.
The feet on the beast are twisted hooves and its hands shaped into three
fingered claws.  From its waist up, vomit-green scales cover its body with the
exception of the many black wart-like cancers that swarm near its neck.
Sprouting from the side of its head is a half meter long horn that curls
around to the other side of its head before it sticks out.  A truly gruesome

The officer is one of the few dozen grunts of the Council Island Police
department.  Not even issued a car, the officer must patrol his beat on foot.
That's not much of a problem though, since the inhabited areas of the island
are so small.  And the uninhabited areas...no one goes there and comes back.

This troll could easily pass for a defensive tackle for the Seattle Seahawks.
Hell, he could pass for the entire defensive line!  Cyber-enhanced muscles
bulge from underneath his armidillo-like dermal sheathing and his quick fluid
motions infer that something other than the reflex system he was born with is
under his skin.  Something about the way his stare pierces your eyes, and
continues through the wall behind, says that you dont want to anger him.
