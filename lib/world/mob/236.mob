A giant white alligator stands here. 

~
LookDesc:$
As you look at the giant white gator you realize the more than earthly
intelligence lurks behind those cold yellow eyes. He is huge and only there to
stop intruders from defiling the home of the person that freed him from
bondage and made him a free spirit.

then trots up to you, expecting something.

A middle-aged man stands here rigidly 

~
LookDesc:$
A tall middle-aged man stands here. From what you can see, he is well muscled
but lean not bulky. His black hair is cut in a tight flattop with only a hint
of grey showing in the short hair on the side. A rough scar runs from inside
the hairline and terminates at his chin. It would run through his eye except
that an ancient cybereye sits in it's path. You know the eye is old due to
it's construction, more a blocky metal prosthesis than an implant. It's angry
red glow twinkles as he surveys the room. He moves with economy, as if
ensuring no energy is wasted. And though his face seems set in a permanent
scowl, you sense that he does not lose control but rather executes his
decisions with deliberate determination.

A ceiling-mounted suppressive turret guards the area.

LookDesc:$
Equipped with advanced sensors and ultrasonic detection systems, this turret
is hard to evade. Armor plating shrowds everything right down the the
mounting, and a large barrel that seems to be fit for 7.62mm rounds portrudes
from the structure.

Name:	Sophia Dymier
RoomDesc:$
A very young, kobalt blue night-one girl is here. 

~
LookDesc:$
This small night-one girl is covered in pleasant, kobalt blue colored fur. She
seems very well taken care of, posessing nicely kept hair that is just
slightly brighter than her fur. It flows loosely down to the middle of her
back, and small groups of it are placed forward from her elvish ears. A pair
of big and vivid purple eyes stand out among a vaguely narrow face, and add an
innocent compliment to a small, bright pink mouth. She stands shy of 5 feet,
more around the 4 foot 10 inches mark. Her build is slender, but far from a
toothpick, and she seems to have a subtle hint of athletecism about her.
