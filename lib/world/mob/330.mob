A pretty elven Spacebucks barista works the counter here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Hired specifically by Spacebucks to appeal to a high-end elven crowd, this
pretty little dame certainly doesn't disappoint. Aside from the fact she could
probably model in her off-hours, she appears to be quite an experienced
barista to boot. She single-handedly fills and blends orders to match her
customers desires, working swiftly and gracefully all the while.

RoomDesc:$
An irate elven bard dripping dramatic flair is here, pacing back and forth. 

~
LookDesc:$
This elven fellow has a wiry physique, and is decked out in all the pomp and
circumstance that Royal Tir scrip can buy. He's obviously a performer, that
much is noticable from even the briefest of glances. From the way he holds his
head, his mannerisms, and even the way he walks, all drips with a dramatic
flair that one would expect from someone who makes their home on the stage,
feeding off the watchful eyes of their adoring public. He looks absolutely
livid and irate as he paces back and forth along the red bricks under foot,
apparently upset over something.

This fair skinned fiend seems to be playing up the part of the stereotypical
villain to the tee, complete with an evil mustache, which he twirls maniacally
as he plots and schemes his evil deeds. He holds, clutched in his grasp, a
thick pile of hand written notes and papers.

A beautiful elven Lordstrums Department Store clerk helps customers here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Since this store caters to those of the higher social classes of the Tir,
their workers certainly have to reflect this appearance, and this beautiful
elven lass does so with style. Tall, long-legged and graceful to boot, she
wears her long golden hair in a conservative, yet very appealing manner. She
flashes a smile that could empty wallets at a moments notice, and puts it to
work helping do just that, all too happy to make a sale.

An older man wearing copper-framed spectacles sits here, enjoying a coffee.

LookDesc:$
While elves may not age past a certain point in their life, remaining spry
with a youthful physique that's enjoyed through their long lives, this
particular elf isn't the case for that. While his body is young, his face
bears the signs of aging, and perhaps, wisdom. Crows feet peek out from behind
the copper-rimmed spectacles he wears, sporting the look upon his face as a
man who has seen much of the world. He sips on his hot coffee, enjoying a
fresh newspaper atop a stack of folders and books.

Dressed down in a simple two piece black suit, clean and tidy in appearance,
he manages to give off a feeling of professionalism, even though he may
occasional have to make a few 'less than polite' remarks to any non-elven
visitors that may wander in. He serves up drinks, and passes off any trays of
food that come out of the kitchen behind the bar to the waiters, who in turn
carry them off to patrons enjoying their privacy in other portions of The
Cave.

Like most patrons of this particular establishment, this man is not only

the way his gaze wanders across the faces of passerbys hints towards some
other agenda for his presence here, aside from the orkish cuisine.

He looks like any other wageslave you mind find milling around the streets of
Portland, except for maybe the fact he's a little more high-end than most,
probably some corporate middleman. He's attempting to enjoy his meal, but even
the toned down ork cuisine seems to be a bit too rich for his tastes. None the
less, he's not about to just let it go to waste, he spent good money on it
afterall.

pointed ears look like he's had a rat chewing on them.
