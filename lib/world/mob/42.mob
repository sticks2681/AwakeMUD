RoomDesc:$
A Dark Robed Initiate Master stands here, gazing at the group.

~
LookDesc:$
Embued with almost unspeakable energy, this man glows with an eerie light
that few have the luck to see in their lifetimes. It really is amazing. He
watches over the initiation group, and monitors their progress much like a
father looking over his family.

RoomDesc:$
A massive muscle-bound madman with a moustache glares at you.

LookDesc:$
A deep pale cover of hardened skin barely contains this very angry
looking brute. Growling, sniveling, yet all the while confined to his
cage like a warthog on antibiotics, Frederick is no happier about this
predicament than you are. However, he is here to train you, to make you
the BEST you can be! Use his help wisely.

RoomDesc:$
A black guard captain stands at the foot of the gates.

~
LookDesc:$
Three silver stripes and a jackal on his right shoulder tell you a little
more than you'd like to know about this character. He sports the same
suit of mobile armor as the other black guards, yet he looks pensive,
far more intelligent and unscrupulous than any of the other guards. Do not
forget however, that in this case, intelligence and a lack of scruples are
the last things you're looking for at the moment.

The guy is huge. He appears to be using a specialised rifle, unlike almost any
