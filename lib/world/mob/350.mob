Name:	A rich elven patron
RoomDesc:$
A handsome elven woman, bedecked in furs, glares down her nose. 

~
LookDesc:$
Wearing enough furs to deplete a species, this woman is the embodiment of
gaudiness. Bands of gold and other precious metals weigh down her arms, and a
pair of armless glasses balances upon her upraised nose - a nose she is often
looking down. She is not beautiful, as she is past the prime of even an elf's
lifetime, but she carries herself with the stately air of wealth, and so could
be described as handsome, though she radiates arrogance like a fire does heat.

She is young, no more than 17, with blonde hair in a ponytail that just about

Rook is a massive troll with a pair of thin silver glasses balanced upon his
nose. His skin is very tough and dark gray, like granite. It seems he was the
victim of a Petrify spell gone awry, and managed to turn it into an advantage
- armorlike skin. It's almost enough of a demonstration of his magical might
in and of itself, but the brain-numbingly complex formula emerging under his
quick pen proves it that much more completely. How amazing is it, then, when
he offers to share his knowledge?

symbol on the breast of his armor - a pentagram overlaid on the usual LoneStar
symbol - marks him as an officer of the LoneStar Supernova Squad, a
special-ops division used to handle extremely high-threat situations.

Keywords:	irishman lone star officer ex-officer o'malley unshaven
Name:	ex-officer O'Malley
RoomDesc:$
An unshaven Irishman in a ragged Lone Star uniform stands here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Standing six foot three with black hair and green eyes, Officer O'Malley would
look rather impressive... if he didn't look like he just got mugged. His Lone
Star uniform is unbuttoned, showing a white t-shirt he has long since sweat
through. His face carries several days of unshaven stubble and his eyes glare
glassily from the centers of dark rings. His black hair in an unkempt tangle,
and hangs greasily from his head. Oddly enough, he is not wearing a badge...
perhaps not so oddly... Rough as he looks, it's really no wonder he reeks
horribly of cheap alchohol and strong cigarettes, and the way his hands
twitch, he's probably already on the breaking point.

#35199
Keywords:	elf kaylin leger child goddess
Name:	Kaylin Leger
RoomDesc:$
A child floats, cross-legged, a few feet above the ground. 

~
LookDesc:$
A child of no more than ten, Kaylin is the picture of innocence. Black hair
hangs in rings down her back, with some pulled forward to frame her pale face.
The tips of her pointy ears show past her hair, and those big green eyes seem
to see more than they let on. She always dresses in simple clothes, except for
her coat, which her father, Jean Leger, gave her many years ago. Kaylin, like
her father, is much more than she seems.
