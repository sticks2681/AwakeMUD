A lone star officer scans the area here.

LookDesc:$
McRee is a rather large senior officer in the Lone Star force. His short brown
hair stands atop a very stern looking face, and he looks ready to snap at any
moment. He seems to have 5 times the muscle mass of a normal human, almost
approaching the look of a troll. However, it is wildly known McRee very rarely
results to violence, and is prized by Lone Star for his negotiation and
prisoner interrogation skills. It's also rumoured he is prone to take a little
on the side to overlook infringements.
