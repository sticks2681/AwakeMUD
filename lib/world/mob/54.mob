RoomDesc:$
A armored hovercraft stalks through the area menacingly 

~
LookDesc:$
It looks alot like a normal Ares Citymaster yet it has been modified to ride
on a hovercraft type air skirt in order to be able to sail across the columbia
river should the need arise. Studded with weaponry and no doubt packed with
high-tech equipment if one is to take this bad boy on they better be well
equipped.

A elf dressed in thick brown leathers stands here with a paranoid look in his
eyes. 

~
LookDesc:$
It looks to be a mountain man that unlike those of the tribe seems to prefer
his own company. Its likely he's just in town to buy supplies before heading
out into the forest again. He looks unarmed but the muscles that are visible
on him look strong and wiry tough. This guy is living a hard life and the
scars on his arms and lines crossing his heavily tanned skin show it.

A Troll stands here looking very out of place

Dressed in very little but a woven skirt to cover his crotch he does happen to
wear a few necklaces woven of grass and ornamented with carved bark showing
amerindian art, much of it focused on Salmon. In a sack across is back he
keeps a traditional fishing net and spear that looks meant for fishing. His
dark green skin is deeply creased and has the consistency of well-worn
leather. Much of the dermal deposits on his body have been worn down and now
are little more than white bumps that break up the dark green coloration of
his skin now and than.
