Name:	Doom
RoomDesc:$
A fierce-looking troll in red and orange colors. 

~
LookDesc:$
It is a towering troll. Really towering. Though still belonging to the troll
race, this individual is so chromed that he could be often mistaken for a
cyberzombie. The equipment he usually carries with him is also of very high
quality, but also very-highly illegal. He belongs to a gang called the Kult,
who are themselves their protection against the poor local army.

spends most of the time eating and watching TV by his shop, while not serving

RoomDesc:$
A woman dressed in a black outfit is here. 

~
LookDesc:$
She is a rather young-looking, but, in fact, old woman. She's got memories
about almost everything that happened in the last fifty years. She's not that
famous johnson, but seems to be one of the first that started activity over
the amazonian jurisdiction. She wears a black outfit and spends most of the
time waiting for potential shadowrunners at her hideout.
