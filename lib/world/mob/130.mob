A construction worker attends the machinery.

LookDesc:$
Hardly similar to the stereotypical 20th-century ass-crack-showing
construction worker, these men are effectively the executive versions of said
lackeys. They're cleaner, better-dressed and presumably better-qualified.

A middle-aged man oversees the workers.

LookDesc:$
Whoever this guy is, no matter what he does, he is obviously someone
important. As he walks quietly and slowly through the corridors, two
bodyguards accompany his every step. He is dressed in an expensive suit, with
a sharp modern chic image carried below the expensive fabrics. He is not that
aged, at least not as old as you might expect of one with such protection. He
has a full head of hair, and tanned skin. Dark brown eyes glow at you, and
everything he oversees, as he strolls around the complex.
