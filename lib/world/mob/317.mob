Sharply dressed in retro-classic fashions, the Matchsticks Manager, Carl
Steward, stands around here schmoozing with the Matchsticks' clientele. If
he's not talking to customers, he's dealing with representatives of the many
different bands he books to the club. He's also the man to talk to about
Matchstick Club Membership.

Name:	a friendly, human bartender
RoomDesc:$
A friendly, human bartender named Al stands behind the bar. 

~
LookDesc:$
Neither tall nor short, this man stands behind the bar waiting to take your
order. The products from years of perpetual smiles, dimples show through his
well-trimmed, chestnut brown beard. His eyes, a deep, understanding brown,
suggest he's a man to be trusted with anything from important business, to
that unfortunate 'issue' you may be having in bed. In typical bartender
fashion, the man looks like one who'll listen when no one else will.

Name:	Patches, MIDG's pet hellhound
RoomDesc:$
A hellhound, with patches of white in its fur, prowls around here 

~
LookDesc:$
This, rather large, hellhound seems too friendly to deserve the name. He looks
at you with the age old curious puppy expression and comes over to sniff your
hand. He gives your hand a small lick then goes off to explore more of this
place. You figure this must be Kremlin's pet, as the name tag reads 'Patches'

RoomDesc:$
A guy that only has one shoe on is slumped over here. 

~
LookDesc:$
This is an old, unkempt, smelly ass bum who reeks of cheap liquor, pot, and
stale urine. He's wearing really dirty clothes that probably weren't even cool
when they were made, and only has a shoe (no sock) on his left foot. His right
foot, however, is not without protection: it has a brown paper bag over it,
kept in place with a rubber band around the ankle.
