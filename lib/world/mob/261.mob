A bear of incredible size and indescribable beauty stands placidly before you.

It is an incredible bear, the very paragon of bearness. Huge, with muscles
like titanium cable, the bear just sort of stands there, a sage look upon its
brown-furred features. Its image is one of impossible power and ageless
wisdom, and it verily seems to radiate the placid but unstoppable magic of the
Bear.

A very regal, fluffy white Persian cat sits grooming itself. 

~
LookDesc:$
It is a fluffy white Persian, representing all that is catlike. Fluffy and
white and impeccably groomed, it is everything a cat should be - regal,
poised, proud, and every inch the intellectual hunter. From nose to tail it is
catly perfection personified, and verily seems to shine with the impish,
mischeivious, and inescapable power of the Cat.

RoomDesc:$
A coyote sits here, shrouded in the desert sand, and radiant with a lunar
glow. 

~
LookDesc:$
It is the pinnacle of all things coyote. Its fur is smooth and whole, not a
hint of imperfection anywhere. Its teeth are clean and shine in the watery
moonlight that seems to perpetually surround it. As it throws back its head,
its howl holds a steady, clear note and seems to resonate in the night air.

A casually dressed volunteer firefighter stands here.

LookDesc:$
If you want to get a good idea of who can be a firefighter, just imagine the
population of a community as a whole. Remove those with respiratory problems,
eyesight problems, low upper body strength, weight problems, and a lack of
courage. Then select those with a sprinkle of dare-devil bravado, and a sense
of civic responsibility. After all that you have a good idea of who exactly
this man, and his fellow volunteers might be. He might be a little rough
around the edges, and he might not be a snappy dresser. He might be rich or
poor, and he might have seventeen kids. But when push comes to shove, he puts
his life on the line to dive into the breach against an enemy older than
metahumanity itself.

This man is older than his peers, and looks like he is in his early to mid
forties. He is missing the index finger on his left hand. Burn scars cover his
hands, and forearms. Streaks of gray are eating away at the threads of his
brown hair. Nonetheless he carries himself with a sense of command. A small
badge on his breast marks him as the fire captain of a Seattle volunteer fire
department.
