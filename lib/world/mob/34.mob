Shes overly cheerful and way too eager to help out customers, and apparently

Her enthusiasm is kind of creepy, actually, and one would be hard pressed to

RoomDesc:$
A hard working wageslave hurries around here, busting his chops. 

~
LookDesc:$
Just your run-of-the-mill wageslave, breaking his back for the higher-ups,
with some small glimmer of hope that they might one day climb up a rung or two
on the old corporate ladder. Sleep deprived? Yep. Caffiene junkie? Definately.
Social life? None to speak of. Chance to advance? Ha, slim to none.

RoomDesc:$
A lightly-armed JNL security guard blocks the way here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Hes a tall, well-built security guard decked out in bland grey light security
armour. He eyes non-employees up suspiciously, since its his job to keep tabs
on who comes and goes, afterall. Parked at his hip is a heavy pistol, wether
or not he knows how to use it is another matter.

RoomDesc:$
A cold scientist wearing a heavy labcoat mills around here. 

~
LookDesc:$
Hes a scientist, obviously, or atleast thats what he looks like. Maybe its the
thick glasses and heavy labcoat that tipped you off? He mills around,
occasionally checking the various scientific instruments and displays as they
churn out information to be consumed. He doesn't even take notice that anyone
has disturbed his cold room, since afterall, if you don't have the proper
access, you shouldn't be here, right?

LookDesc:$
The chief of Cascade Ork, Pawl Shaggy Mountain, Stands here nobly. Draped from
his huge build are multiple Piasma, Bandit and Hellohound pelts. His ebony
amerindian hair has been braided in a traditional Jar'Arak style with 12
braids each being tipped with a bear claw. At his side is a huge revolver that
looks like it could blow the head right off a raging Grizzly Bear. Other items
that show technology are his mono bladed daggers which he keeps tucked into
his thick elk hide boots. This contrasts greatly with his numerous magical
pouches and his ornately carved staff which he varries in his huge hands.
