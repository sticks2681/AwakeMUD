LongDesc:$
The cheapness and intensive marketing of this nifty little car has made it the
most common car to see on the North American highways these days. This
electric model is cheaper than its methane sister, both by way of features,
speed and cheapness of the fuel. The only advantage is the extra seat in the
back.

Welcome to the extra seat in the back. It's certainly... a seat.~

ShortDesc:	A Jackrabbit-M
RoomDesc:	A Chrysler-Nissan Jackrabbit-M sits with the engine off
LongDesc:$
A bigger sister of the Jackrabbit-E, this methane-fueled car is a common
sight on the highways. Sporting a higher maximum speed, greater acceleration
afforded by a combustion engine this car costs that bit more than the
Jackrabbit-E but is worth it. 
~
Inside:$
The inside of this car is small, barely large enough for an ork to get in. The
two bucket seats take up most of the room, the engine the rest. Everything
seems to be made of plastic, grey plastic. The center of the console features
a matrix radio, ready to pump out the latest hot tunes for you to listen to.

Although the inside is slightly large than its methane based cousin, whoever

a plasticoated titanium.  In the dash is a large array of computer equipment,
monitoring every aspect of the automobile from battery charges to fuel
efficiency and mileage, to the speed at which you are zooming down the road.
The Eurocar has a HEAT automatic transmission which includes a variable gear

LongDesc:$
Small and sleek, the Ford Americar is Ford's best selling car in the UCAS, and
has been for many years. Its reliability can't be argued with, especially for
the price. 
~
Inside:$
These days, Ford isn't best known for the lavish interiors, in fact it makes
you think of a toned-down pick-up truck. But for all the pseudo-hill-billyness
of it, it's still a good decent thing. And with an efficient engine, that
doesn't generate much noise or heat, it's easily the runner's car of choice. 
~
InsideRear:$
The standard rear bench seat has been substituted with twin bucket seats,
allowing a more compact rear end. The seats are more utilitarian than
comfortable, but if you're riding in the back of one of these things, you
aren't in much of a position to be picky.

The twin front seats of this behemoth are built more like the cockpit of a

padding to spare your posterior on those long trips.

The back end of the Bison is huge, enough for a family to live in for quite a

The trailer of the GMC 4201 is huge, it has the capacity to carry at least 3
standard cars inside of it with room to spare. In a pinch you could probably
fit about 50 seats in here, safety would be a prime concern however.

RoomDesc:	An Ares RoadMaster sits ominously at the curb
LongDesc:$
This is the basic model of the Ares Master Series, Ares main security related
vehicle. It has a large cargo capacity which could easily be utilized in many
different ways, from smuggling to security work.  
~
Inside:$
The inside of the Roadmaster is nothing flash, in fact it could be described
as Drab. As the standard model it comes with no extras to speak of. Driving
around in one of these though is sure to attract attention from people, as it
just has that Ares Master feel about it, you know, the one that makes you want
to run before the man bust you? 
~
InsideRear:$
The rear of the RoadMaster is roomy in the standard model. You could easily
fit quite a few extra seats in here, maybe even a workshop or drone control
center for the more technically inclined. Even if armor plating were added
there would still be more than enough room in here for an entire team of armed
security personnel.

The Rhiati handles the road with insanely smooth accuracy, creating a ride, as
one would say that is "like buttah"...  Tir Tairngire engineering from the
Rhiati corporation, the automotive wing of Telestrian Industries Corporation.
Everything on the riding end is designed for pure comfort on the road, from
the handle grips to the seat.  For the hardcore motorcycling enthusiast, a
switch exists which allows you to toggle electric ignition or the more
'classic' kick-starting. 
~
Inside:$
A ride like a dream, with speed to match.  The Rhiati Razor handles like a
surgeon's blade, operating with to-the-millimeter precision on the road.  And
it doesn't lose any handling when taken up to insane racing speeds, it just
weaves around traffic as if it were walking through an obstacle course.

The sidecar shell houses a single, quite comfortable bucket seat, along with a

convenience, as well as creature comforts such as a full wet bar, wide screen

princely.  The computer messages and the audio notifications are all in
